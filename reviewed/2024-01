Description: This is the Kubernetes docs, specifically the area on repositories. It's actually a little confusing, because one of the use cases is actually an example of not needing a private repo -- everything is open source code. It then goes on to explain how to set up a private repo and what controllers you need to ensure you arbitrate access correctly -- you may not want certain pods to run outside of specific nodes. It's a few paragraphs inside of a much larger doc, but the private registry parts are decent.
BottomLine: Good explaination of how to run private repos for images in Kubernetes

Description: It's an inforgraphic, so let's go. It's on Kubernetes security, and tells you what not to ignore. It covers RBAC, Pod Security, Network policies, Encryption and Logging as seperate points. Each point has 2 bullets, so not too much is covered on each area. All of the points are very high level, and the illustration level is not very high for a visual medium. There points are all solid, so it's a good quick overview.
BottomLine: Infographic that is a decent high-level toe dip to Kubernetes security

Description: Our article is going to tackle what the "dry run" command is and how to use it. We start with a definition, where they explain the dry run command shows you what the impact of your change would be, without actually making any actual changes to Kubernetes resources. We then review the client-side version of dry run, which just shows you what commands would be sent to the back end. The more interesting bit is sending them to the server, which is done with a different flag, and we'll be told how this would impact the cluster. They then explain how to run through the process, and include a couple of quick examples. It would be helpful if they'd done a bit more on the example side, but this is adequate for an intro.
BottomLine: Decent intro to the Kubernetes dry run command and some examples
