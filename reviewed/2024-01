Description: This is the Kubernetes docs, specifically the area on repositories. It's actually a little confusing, because one of the use cases is actually an example of not needing a private repo -- everything is open source code. It then goes on to explain how to set up a private repo and what controllers you need to ensure you arbitrate access correctly -- you may not want certain pods to run outside of specific nodes. It's a few paragraphs inside of a much larger doc, but the private registry parts are decent.
BottomLine: Good explaination of how to run private repos for images in Kubernetes
