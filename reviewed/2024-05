Description: This article is about deploying Moodle on Kubernetes, so let's get started. The approach of our authors is to leverage an Operator, which they say works as a meta-operator to handle the entire stack, including Postgres, and other apps and even Moodle itself. They then try to sell us, explaining this gives us automatic deployment, meta-operator arch, full stack management and CRDs, with a sentence of explaination. We are then taken through the why of this approach, but honestly they still haven't explained why Operators are the way to go or anything about how they work by this point. They then explain how to get started, which is a quick three step hand wave at the process; to their credit, they do link to the docs which give a better runthrough. They then have a blurb for their managed service, where they run all of this for you. Ok, so my impression is one of disappointment -- I was interested in how Moodle can be married with K8s, and there isn't much here. If you were a Moodle person this means basically nothing, as they only mention Moodle in passing. Even as someone who has worked with K8s before, they don't explain why THIS is the way to run Moodle on K8s. It MIGT be a great way, but this article doesn't sell it like that.
BottomLine: Article on using Moodle on Kubernetes which isn't up to snuff
