Description: This article is about deploying Moodle on Kubernetes, so let's get started. The approach of our authors is to leverage an Operator, which they say works as a meta-operator to handle the entire stack, including Postgres, and other apps and even Moodle itself. They then try to sell us, explaining this gives us automatic deployment, meta-operator arch, full stack management and CRDs, with a sentence of explaination. We are then taken through the why of this approach, but honestly they still haven't explained why Operators are the way to go or anything about how they work by this point. They then explain how to get started, which is a quick three step hand wave at the process; to their credit, they do link to the docs which give a better runthrough. They then have a blurb for their managed service, where they run all of this for you. Ok, so my impression is one of disappointment -- I was interested in how Moodle can be married with K8s, and there isn't much here. If you were a Moodle person this means basically nothing, as they only mention Moodle in passing. Even as someone who has worked with K8s before, they don't explain why THIS is the way to run Moodle on K8s. It MIGT be a great way, but this article doesn't sell it like that.
BottomLine: Article on using Moodle on Kubernetes which isn't up to snuff

Description: This article is going to talk about cloud logging, which is an interesting topic. They talk first about gathering all logs in one place, which is a good strategy. They are going to take us through a lab, using Terraform to deploy a log generating app so we can fiddle with cloud logs. Next, we have a diagram, and explain we'll use a K8s GKE cluster to generate logs which will be fed into stackdriver and then the cloud log we want to see. They set some configs, and then have the whole TF file - not in a small download box, but written out in full; it has comments, but no explaination. No CLI commands, just screenshots of TF running. We then visit a dashboard to confirm the cluster is running. We then visit the apps web page several times to generate log entries. We then take a peek at the web UI for viewing log entries. They talk about feeding logs into cloud storage and BigQuery for other analysis. So, I'm disappointed; the article is loose and sloppy - it handwaves at creation and ignores explaining what to do or why. It also seems to think logs are for debugging in the moment, and not for looking back -- it does cover long-term persistent storage, but more as a bonus then as a central theme.
BottomLine: Interesting topic of cloud logging but not well covered here
