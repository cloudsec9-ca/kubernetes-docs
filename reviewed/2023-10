Description: I've read a few of these error code articles, and they can be good; and this one starts with a "what K8s is". Actually, it only covers 6 errors, but they are often encountered, and it's well done. The author gives us a bit of info about what the error is, possible causes and a snip to get more concrete info. It's a good resource.
BottomLine: Goes through six common Kubernetes errors and their fixes
