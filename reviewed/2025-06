Description: Our article today goes into 13 Kubernetes alternatives you might consider using. Each alternative has specific use cases, and they as a group have a wide variety of interesting things they do. The format follows the same basics for each one - name of package, a small blurb, the website, key features and a when to use blurb. I'll list all the alternatives, which are each given the same treatment - OpenShift, Nomad, Mesos, Swarm, ECS, Tanzu, Netlify, Cloud run, Incus, CloudFoundry, Docker, Rancher and Azure Container instances (ACI). They range from single devel. focus to enterprise, from container runners to full general clusters. I think the idea is to see if your use case can be better served with a different approach, and there are a diversity of that here.
BottomLine: Great survey of alternatives to Kubernetes for deployments
