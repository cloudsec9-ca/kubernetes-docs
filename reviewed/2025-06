Description: Our article today goes into 13 Kubernetes alternatives you might consider using. Each alternative has specific use cases, and they as a group have a wide variety of interesting things they do. The format follows the same basics for each one - name of package, a small blurb, the website, key features and a when to use blurb. I'll list all the alternatives, which are each given the same treatment - OpenShift, Nomad, Mesos, Swarm, ECS, Tanzu, Netlify, Cloud run, Incus, CloudFoundry, Docker, Rancher and Azure Container instances (ACI). They range from single devel. focus to enterprise, from container runners to full general clusters. I think the idea is to see if your use case can be better served with a different approach, and there are a diversity of that here.
BottomLine: Great survey of alternatives to Kubernetes for deployments

Description: The article for today is an introduction to Defender for Containers written by Microsoft. It's a high level document, with an exec summary upfront and then a bit of a deeper dive further in. The four core areas it addresses are security posture management, vuln assessment, run time threat protection and Deployment and monitoring. Each gets a para upfront, then 3 to 4 paras in the deeper dive. For those on Azure, it might be a good option.

Description: Today's article is a bit of a pitch, selling us on using Portainer as a service. The idea here is that you want to use containers, but you don't want to learn how to run or manage the container, but just focus on your own code. They cover all the important aspects, like security, scaling, and management. They provide tech experts to do the container management and grunt work. I'd say this is perfect for startups or dev-only teams looking to stay out of managing the orchestration of clusters. It does have a niche.
BottomLine: Good pitch on using Portainer to run managed containers

Description: Our article today is a short one on using probes the right way. Starts with a bit of background about what probes are and do, then talks about each one - startup, liveness and readiness. Each section has a para on what role the probe has, a sample config, and key takeaways to optimize each. It has some tips at the end and wraps with other configs that might be interesting.
BottomLine: Good short intro to the various Kubernetes probes
