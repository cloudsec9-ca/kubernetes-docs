Description: The apparent focus of this article is how using an ambient mesh allows you to not use sidecars, or so the title says. Sidecars have issues, but they never really explain that, or tell us how mesh handles this really, other than handwaving that sidecars require "high skill". Now I personally know just a bit about sidecars, and I understand the concept of mesh, but none of that was enhanced by reading this article. I get that sidecars require another container that you save if you don't use them, and they talk a bit about that. We then go on a journey through the marketing tent talking about "friction" and "zero trust", with no examples or concrete tie to mesh. Oh, and before the end, we are told there is a place sometimes for sidecars. There is also an example, where they mention that deploying needs careful planning with sidecars, because they are coupled closely to the application? Now, there IS a short video, but I get the feeling that an editor cut something out, because a bunch of the connections are not there.
BottomLine: Buzzword compliant without much meat

Description: I'll admit I was expecting a bit more when the upfront graphic was a fully drawn out Kubernetes cluster, and I thought this would be a deep dive. But this is actually an announcement and a bit of tech trivia, and for that it is simple, clear, and to the point. Apparently before Kubernetes v1.19, logs went to flat string, but as of .19, you can now output JSON formatted logs. I'm not sure this changes things for human viewers, but it allows parsing tools a chance to pull bits out for observability and alerting, so that is good.
BottomLine: Good new feature announcement

Description: Another article that starts strong and ends with a whimper. Starting with a solid premise that something that is complex to set up can be a challenge to secure, it backs up some statements with numbers. But, other times it btings gems like "sometimes leading to the loss [of money]". Now the article is based on a RedHat survey, but it feels like the take here is more about "containers bad and scary". It does talk about building security into the process and mentions devsecops, and ends with some RedHat recommendations.
BottomLine: Handwavy overview, ok as a quick first glance

Description: Okay, I really liked the premise of this article, and had hopes -- there isn't a lot about cost or budgeting for Kubernetes. And, if you don't know what you are using, you might be overspending -- fair point. But a few paragraphs in, we are shocked to learn that only 38% of developers can predict cloud spend within 10%. So wait, devs have to write good code, fast, and do so securely, AND be able to forecast usage to be able to predict spend? I can't say I'm onboard with that bit. I think there is a lot of opportunity to talk about tuning K8s, and getting a better fit for workloads -- but this artticle handwaves at that, and pitches - a commercial product. Now, I'm not against including paid products in the mix, but it's curious that the report that is used for much of the article AND the sponsor just happen to be the same as the product pitched? The report might be worth a look, but this article is a bust.
BottomLine: Just a thinly-veiled product pitch
