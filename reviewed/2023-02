Description: Coming from OWASP, you know it's going to be impactful recommendations and good stuff. I haven't gone through the whole thing in great detail, but they do a great job of explaining and have a solid gameplan. It looks like the approach is through the lifecycle, and it goes through all of the bits and tells you what the best practices are.
BottomLine: Recommended
