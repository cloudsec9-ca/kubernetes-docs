Description: Coming from OWASP, you know it's going to be impactful recommendations and good stuff. I haven't gone through the whole thing in great detail, but they do a great job of explaining and have a solid gameplan. It looks like the approach is through the lifecycle, and it goes through all of the bits and tells you what the best practices are.
BottomLine: Recommended

Description: This being a Forbes article, I wasn't expecting a heavy tech focus, and while it does include lots of acronyms, it is a bit light on the tech. It focuses a lot on a specific product while trying to seem like it's surveying the field, but doesn't do a great job of explaining why this product is the exemplar, and doesn't really talk to other tools, what they do, and why this approach is the best. Have to say I'm not a big fan of the "cleaning" theme the author uses through much of the article. There is a sprinkle of facts and a bit from the CNCF, but generally it's a light piece. Might be good to see the more biz-side appraoch to Kubernetes and Cloud security, but most of this should be common knowledge for Cloud pros.
BottomLine: Decent read

DateReviewed: 2023-02-15
Description: Short but to the point. One of the tips is to use multicloud, which works well if you are just using compute, but is much harder if you are using any SaaS from a provider. Another tip is to use serverless, which is a good way to reduce costs, but feels more like a cloud tip then a Kubernetes related one.
BottomLine: First 3 tips are decent

DateReviewed: 2023-02-15
Description: While I agree that visualization tools are valuable, this article starts slow and the first two diagrams are on the weak side of trying to help you understand things -- they seem lightweight, hard to read and don't really say much. Now, reading the text the tool seems nice, as it generates up to date and on the fly diagrams, enabling you to see a real-time view, which is great. But the diagrams they use in support don't pop and tell you a story. I think an animated GIF or a short video demo might have worked a lot better. 
BottomLine: Interesting tool, not a great article

DateReviewed: 2023-02-17
Description: Takes on the tricky bit of deploying stateful apps in a container to Kubernetes. Talks about both storage and getting state set up. For storage, it mentions local but recommends remote persistent, and talks about both cloud provider storage and an option for self-hosted K8s. For state, it chats about using native Kubernetes features and also mentions a way to do this if using Helm.
BottomLine: Good read

DateReviewed: 2023-02-17
Description: This article looks at a unique way to access Kubernetes workloads -- through the APIs that are exposed by both the control plane and on individual nodes. It walks us through how things are set up, what the exposure might be, how to take advantage of it, and how to mitigate or prevent it.
BottomLine: Interesting attack
