Description: Coming from OWASP, you know it's going to be impactful recommendations and good stuff. I haven't gone through the whole thing in great detail, but they do a great job of explaining and have a solid gameplan. It looks like the approach is through the lifecycle, and it goes through all of the bits and tells you what the best practices are.
BottomLine: Recommended

DateReviewed: 2023-02-14
Description: This being a Forbes article, I wasn't expecting a heavy tech focus, and while it does include lots of acronyms, it is a bit light on the tech. It focuses a lot on a specific product while trying to seem like it's surveying the field, but doesn't do a great job of explaining why this product is the exemplar, and doesn't really talk to other tools, what they do, and why this approach is the best. Have to say I'm not a big fan of the "cleaning" theme the author uses through much of the article. There is a sprinkle of facts and a bit from the CNCF, but generally it's a light piece. Might be good to see the more biz-side appraoch to Kubernetes and Cloud security, but most of this should be common knowledge for Cloud pros.
BottomLine: Decent read

DateReviewed: 2023-02-15
Description: Short but to the point. One of the tips is to use multicloud, which works well if you are just using compute, but is much harder if you are using any SaaS from a provider. Another tip is to use serverless, which is a good way to reduce costs, but feels more like a cloud tip then a Kubernetes related one.
BottomLine: First 3 tips are decent

DateReviewed: 2023-02-15
Description: While I agree that visualization tools are valuable, this article starts slow and the first two diagrams are on the weak side of trying to help you understand things -- they seem lightweight, hard to read and don't really say much. Now, reading the text the tool seems nice, as it generates up to date and on the fly diagrams, enabling you to see a real-time view, which is great. But the diagrams they use in support don't pop and tell you a story. I think an animated GIF or a short video demo might have worked a lot better. 
BottomLine: Interesting tool, not a great article

DateReviewed: 2023-02-17
Description: Takes on the tricky bit of deploying stateful apps in a container to Kubernetes. Talks about both storage and getting state set up. For storage, it mentions local but recommends remote persistent, and talks about both cloud provider storage and an option for self-hosted K8s. For state, it chats about using native Kubernetes features and also mentions a way to do this if using Helm.
BottomLine: Good read

DateReviewed: 2023-02-17
Description: This article looks at a unique way to access Kubernetes workloads -- through the APIs that are exposed by both the control plane and on individual nodes. It walks us through how things are set up, what the exposure might be, how to take advantage of it, and how to mitigate or prevent it.
BottomLine: Interesting attack

DateReviewed: 2023-02-17
Description: A good intro to someone who is early in the learning curve associated with doing Kubernetes deployments. Goes over a bunch of the basics, mentions some tools and technics that can be helpful, and points out things that are easy to get wrong.
BottomLine: Good starting troubleshooting guide

URL reference: https://www.solo.io/topics/kubernetes-api-gateway/
DateReviewed: 2023-02-17
Description: This piece covers a newer bit of K8s tech, the "API Gateway". The idea here is to have a wrapper that provides security and auditing as well as allowing the core scalability the K8s provides. They cover a few options for Gateways, talking about provider offerings (Azure and AWS API gateway), Nginx K8s Gateays and the slightly advertis-y "Solo gloo mesh". Overall a good intro, and it isn't too heavy on the ad side so it's worth a read.
BottomLine: Ok perspective on newer feature

DateReviewed: 2023-02-17
Description: It seems this article is written more to appeal to non-cloud or non-container people, rather than people that have container experience. It has decent balance, but the risk of new cloud or container deployments is that where old applications that were brittle were behind secure firewalls, things like Kubernetes are moving those into places where they might have to up their security. Worth a read, but keep caveats in mind.
BottomLine: Okay opinion piece

URL reference: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/security-checklist/
DateReviewed: 2023-02-21
Description: This is a great starting spot for security with Kubernetes. This covers basic things everyone should at least be aware of and check, and goes through many of the components and bits of Kubernetes to show you what you have to consider. As a checklist doesn't know your threat model, this isn't enough on it's own, but it's a great place to get the ball rolling.
BottomLine: Essential starting security read

DateReviewed: 2023-02-22
Description: While this one hits a bunch of major points, it also handwaves a bit too hard at most of them. Early on it has a bit of YAML, and I felt like we were going to get technical, but that was just teasing. The company that sponsored this is doing roles roles for RBAC, and after that section is done, things fall off a bit. In the least privilege section, it states that you should do this, and I agree. But the hard part is figuring out how much you need -- which they don't address at all. So, the things they talk about are good, they just don't say much about them, which is disappointing. Also, there is a tag for "ZeroTrust", and they don't mentione this at all in the actual article.
BottomLine: Skim for the main points
