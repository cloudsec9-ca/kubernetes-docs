Description: This article is more of a quick summary of learning. It does have a small diagram, but there are no real details. On the upside, it does broadly cover both the control plane and the data plane, and in point form goes through the high level components of each.
BottomLine: High level list of some Kubernetes architecture components - skippable

Description: As Kubernetes has a slightly different layout then a traditional network, this article argues that you need a different approach to implementing a firewall. They do mention you could use a firewall in front of all of your K8s cluster, but I think the idea here is that it might not be the most effective guard, unless your ingress is mostly static. They start out with a table of some best practices along with ways to realize them, which is a decent starting point. They then give a primer on pods, service/ingress and Container network interface (CNI). They explain that all pods can communicate to all others by default, and to restrict this we have to implement a Network Policy. We are shown a YAML snip, and shown how to add the restrictions. They even show a deny-all YAML snip, if that is what you want to set as your base. They follow this up with the good advice to audit and monitor your usage, and show how to check from the CLI. They even say certain providers, like GKE allows you to log policy actions. Next up, we look at CNIs, which handle the network layer. They touch on Flannel, Calico, OVN-Kubernetes and Cilium. They point out chosing a CNI that aligns with your use case is very important. They go over various benefits and tradeoffs, allowing an informed decision. A very decent article.
BottomLine: Strong article on firewalls and network controls for Kubernetes
