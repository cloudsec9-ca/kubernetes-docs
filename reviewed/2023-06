Description: This article explains what a security champion is, why they are needed, and what happens when they aren't there. Champions act as the catalyst between tech people (devs but also other IT) and the formal security org. I like the approach and advocacy of tackling security early and being thorough.
BottomLine: Good piece arguing for using Security Champions
