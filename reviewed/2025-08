Description: The article is really a stub around a presentation at a conference of Chaos testing PostgreSQL on Kubernetes. So the outline is running dbs in prod, why run dbs on K8s, running PG on K8s, observability - what's going on, an finally breaking things on purpose. They talk a bit about strategy for DBs, then a bit about DBaaS ... pros and cons, and posture that K8s allows you to change the approach to DBs. It makes things lighter and easier to do. They show a diagram about building a PG cluster, which is easier to do with pods and K8s. They go through a replica failure, and what an "app" sees in comparison. They also look at things if K8s is in the mix.
BottomLine: Interesting discussion of how to use Postgres on Kubernetes

Description: Our article today focuses on distroless images and how they help to simplify Kubernetes. We jump in with a discussion of containers and their backing images, explaining where we started and what this represents. We then dig into the benefits, which include better security, less overhead and size, and simpler maintenance. They have a good formula for using the new images - figure out what your dependencies are, select a base image that works with that, adjust your Dockerfile, and finally test the resulting images. They show us how this works with a multi-stage Dockerfile that sets everything out. They then go through, explaining some of the bits of the file in the main text. One thing they do say is that this approach may not work in all cases -- so see if it fits your use case. Good approach.
BottomLine: Interesting short paper on actually using Distroless for Kubernetes
