Description: Our article today talks about how to enhance your automation approach to improve managability for Kubernetes. After some background, we dive into a what is Kubernetes section, before moving on to the role of automation in Kubernetes. They break this down broadly into Infra automation, Business process auto, and finally Robotic process auto. We then go through a section where they laud the benefits of automation.
BottomLine: Decent article at a high level on Kubernetes automation

Description: This article talks about using encrypted containers to enhance Kubernetes security. This is part two, and in part one the author talked about using signed and encrypted containers with podman. We dive in and examine Confidential containers, and look into the K8s Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). It features things like trasparent memory encryption of secrets and remote attestation to ensure things are secure before allowing access. The entire Pod is subject to TEE, and they note there are helper processes to set up and control the pod - which makes the kernel, command line and root FS all trusted, along with other pieces. There is a link to some other TEE related info, to fill in gaps. We get a diagram (I love diagrams), and they do acknowledge there are a lot of moving parts with a bit of complexity to make this all work. They refer to the system as Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM), which runs inside the TEE. There are some other services that support the various bits to be considered secure, and these are composed of local agents and remote services that validate things. They also point out that the cluster admin is "untrusted", in that they might not have auth to read secrets -- which means special considerations are in order. They have some YAML snips and do a walkthrough of how to set this up, but it's a bit opaque to me. Basically the gist is that there are decryption keys ONLY available inside of the TEE, and those are then used to decrypt the secrets. It's interesting.
BottomLine: Intro into encrypted containers on Kubernetes with a walkthrough

Description: This article talks about simplifying the approach to learning Kubernetes, to get going a bit more quickly. The author is going to help us understand by giving us his learning including trial and error to get things working. He starts with Webhooks, paticularly how mutatinig and validating admission hooks work. They go through an example, with code and YAML, to explain how it works hands-on. We finish up this one with usage of the different hooks. Next is API aggregation layer vs CRDs. They explain that the aggregation layer is a way to expand the K8s API, and can do things like add various auths to the cluster. We're taken through a YAML snip on setting it up. On the CRD side, he has another article he links to for it, cleaning up with a chart of where you would use each one. They also cover Ingress vs Gateway API and StatefulSets vs Deployments vs DaemonSets. Actually a good intro to some more complex K8s topics.
BottomLine: Strong simple introduction to advanced Kubernetes topics

Description: Our article today will argue that where we terminate SSL encryption makes a difference. Specifically, they argue against terminating SSL on something like the AWS LoadBalancer, and instead bringing it to the service mesh. We dive in with a review of service mesh - what we might need it for and why. They show how some people do it, and argue that the LB -> mesh traffic being in the clear is a security weakness. They mention it breaks some assumptions and best practices. It then gives an oddly formatted list of pros and cons, before going through the tradeoffs. It's an interesting piece.
BottomLine: Good argument for bringing SSL to your service mesh rather then the vendor LB for Kubernetes

DateReviewed: 2025-05-05
Description: This article sheds light on new developments around observability in the cloud, along with walking us through how to set it up. We dive in with an example issue, where purchase transactions are failing, but the logs don't point to the issue directly; only after a few hours is a payment API identified. We then pivot to how AI pieces can help us, by observing issues that logs might not otherwise percieve. They also point to the ability to pinpoing root causes by automation. We then move onto open standards, and they talk about OpenTelemetry and open source observability standards. We then go through a 3 step process to deploy OpenTelemetry, to get things started. To tie things up, they touch on DevSecOps and FinOps as emerging areas to consider.
BottomLine: Interesting discussions about a more hands-on approach to Observability in Kubernetes and Cloud Native in general

Description: Today's article dives into service mesh with a look at Istio. We start with a small bit of background, before diving into a bit on What is Istio. Next, we go through why Istio service mesh matters for Kubernetes, doing a bit of a dive there. Then we pivot to Istio arch and components, going through a number of configs and interations. We then look at benefits and limitations, before looking at the future of service mesh. Overall a good intro.
BottomLine: Very solid intro to Service Mesh on Kubernetes looking at Istio

Description: This article is more of a general reporting piece, looking at a range of new tech and announcements in the Kubernetes area. We start off with 4 open source projects, each summarized in a para, before dipping into a few tech articles, finishing up with newly released updates.
BottomLine: Good survey piece talking about a number of Kubernetes related technologies

Description: Our article today will dabble a bit into the area of AI. We're lookinga at a company called Solo which is combining Kubernetes with AI as an agent, to provide workflow tasks, with a thing called kagent. It's a combo of dev tools, AI agents and bits needed to build agents in a K8s env. The company claims it helps DevOps and platform engineers build and run AI agents in Kubernetes. It talks a bit at a high level, but then says they are using MCP as the building blocks, and they explain a bit of how MCP works. There is a bit of talk on securiyt and observability, and then talk about self-serve computing, all at a very high level. The claim is that this tool will reduce the learning curve. My take is that there isn't a lot of details, but lots of hype.
BottomLine: Interesting read on new AI agent builder
