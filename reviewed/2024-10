Description: Our article tackles Kubernetes security, but it does it from a more offensive approach - how do attackers gain access? After a bit of background, we jump into a section called main entry points, and they dedicate some space to attacks that target K8s. We start with app vulns and follow up with server-side request forgery, which gets a good walking through. They cover RBAC and misconfigs, as well as insecure APIs before finishing up with container breakouts. They cover each with at least one para, but some of the more interesting they go 3 or more into. Next up is a section called escaping to the host, where you gain access to the container host from inside the container. They have a laundry list of Docker to Linux capabilities, some of which can enable breakouts. They do go through how to get a reverse shell, with listings and some CLI commands. I think this is interesting myself, and I think the article demonstrates how attackers think and where you might need to think differently.
BottomLine: Decent attack-based approach to Kubernetes security.

Description: We start with Kubernetes awesome, except security. This article has a laundry list approach, and they dive right in. They start with figuring out what issues K8s has, which they enumerate. The rest of their list is in order - RBAC, harden API server, harden cluster nodes, use PSP, use network fabric, log and monitor, supply chain (secure images), backup and finally stay aware of what is going on. Each list entry gets a one sentence definition, then a number of best practices in point form. Not a groundbreaker, but a decent intro to K8s security.

Description: This is an account of how Kubernetes is readied for new versions. We start with a bit of background, and how he got into the K8s distro pipeline. He then talks about shadowing, and what he was actually doing in this. He was a comms shadow, which he thought aligned with his DevRel role. He explains it is about a 14 week process, with 35-40 volunteers working with dev teams to get a release rolled out. He explains how things are organized into SIGs, and how they guide the process from teams and through building until it is officially released. They mention some highlights from this release, as well as what is coming up in the next release. They also go through a short checklist of the things that need to be done before the release, so things are ready once the code is all good. They have a few notes on things like talks and interviews that are either coming up or recently done. Overall an interesting piece.

We then talk about specific configs, like StatefulSets for Kafka brokers and using PV and PVCs to manage storare. They also talk about deploying with Helm to simplify stuff. Next up are best practices, where they touch on resource management, logging, network config and security. They advise to test failover and to optimize for stability.

Next we dive into a survey where over half of the respondents said they have 4 or more years using K8s, which speaks to it's adoption. They also note that 80% say they will build cloud ready versions in the next 5 yrs, as opposed to about 40% today. They then talk a bit about hybrid cloud, and how many are using this. They also have a short section on container data management. My take is it's interesting, but as forecasts go it is vague and waffly.

Description: This article tackles so-called Remocal development, a hybrid of remote and local dev. After a bit of setup, we get into what is a Kubernetes development environment (KDE), and types of, like local and remote. Local is standard development, where you have everything you need on your machine. Remote is wher e you are running a cluster not on the dev box, maybe in the cloud. One key benefit is it can more closely mirror the prod env, as you can have the bits that are required. Drawbacks are it is slower and has a longer feedback loop. We then have a section called what is Remocal dev, which doesn't really tell us what it is. A bit further they talk abour mirrord, which allows the state of the remote cluster to be mirrored locally, to allow for things like debugging and code inspection, and doing things like API lookups. It's an interesting wrinkle in the K8s dev ecosystem.
BottomLine: Article introduces Remocal development for Kubernetes, to enhance coding for Kubernetes

Description: This is a lab where we will learn to use the Kubernetes proxy from the command line. We start with a bit about what the proxy is, and then we dive into setting up a basic proxy. This involves the command "kubectl proxy", which allows access to the K8s API. Accessing the machine on port 8001 from a browser, you can get status of the cluster. They show how to do this with curl for completeness. And, that is it. So, it's not really much of a lab, and while it's part of a series that might be more fullsome, I think they could have covered more uses in this short primer.
BottomLine: Lab that is really a single command to show you how Kubernetes proxy works - skip

Description: The article is a walk through of setting up a load balancer with EKS. They include prereqs and the policy we have to use at the start. We then are directed on how to set up some permissions for our app, notably the web identity perm that we need to get traffic to the cluster. There are a few steps for this, and then we create a bit of YAML to tie our K8s cluster into the identity stuff. We then install Helm and the LB controller, and verify that it is installed and that the service name is correct. We then have to set up the EBS CSI driver, which is noted as needed if we have a 3-tier architecture. Once all of the bits are rolled out, we can hit the LB and get the Robot Shop store. I feel like some of the bits are more hand-wavy, as someone who knows Dev and some K8s and some AWS, I wasn't always sure what they were doing or why.

Description: This article talks about the claim model, and how this differs between the desired and observed state. We start with a couple diagrams, and then dive into what is the claim model. They explain a claim is the minimum required resource, and might only encompass a part of the full desired state requested. It's also a future goal, not an immediate commitment. They do a bit of legwork to help us understand internal state in the Node/Pod and control plane. They do a more intersting examination of this in the storage arena, where an infra admin designates PersistentVolumes, a platform admin might create a Storage Class and developers ask for PersistentVolumeClaims. What's interesting is that on the dev side, they don't have to know anything about the storage, except how much they need. They emphasize how K8s is very decoupled, which allows resources to be allocated and consumed by different parts of the system without regards to one another. They argue that claims make resource provisioning more flexible, as resources aren't tied to fixed existing resources, and can be dynamically tied in where needed. It's an interesting approach to K8s.

Description: This article tries to answer the question of whether ChatGPT can help us solve Kubernetes issues on our cluster. They start with a diagram, which is always good, and then dive right in. They'll use a stack called HolmesGPT as the integration point to a ChatGPT backend. They explain that Holmes solves problems "like a human", looking and issues and fetching missing data until the problem is solved. It uses servers that support function calling which allows it to retrieve precise info. It uses toolsets and runbooks; toolsets provide commands the LLM can execute, and runbooks provide step by step instructions. We then walk through an imaginary issue, where Holmes goes through a number of checks to figure things out. To better understand, we're going to walk through an actual problem - "why is my application not running?". Holmes takes the question and feeds it to the LLM, and see if it has enough data to answer; if not, it figures out what additional data is needed, and gathers it using tools like kubectl. The LLM is then asked if it has enough data now. We then look under the hood, and there is a tools definition YAML, a management Python file and a tool calling Python file which interact to get answers. They now do a walkthrough of the tool, starting with MacOS install instructions. To use the tool, you need a paid OpenAI API key. You provide the key in an ENV variable, and we are ready to go. They first ask a simple question, and tie that to the YAML file. They then ask about alerts being fired, and show what the response is. Next up, we hook in a private LLM, presumably to use a model which is more trained on our type of data. After lauding the features of one, we now connect Holmes to it, by changing some ENV variables. They run through some questions, getting similar outputs. Okay, so my take is that AI doesn't know if it "has enough data", it usually has some kind of "confidence" in the answer it produces, but that isn't surfaced here. And while I like the idea of a "private" LLM, it's just a different provider and not your own hosted model in this circumstance. It's an interesting approach though.
BottomLine: Interesting walkthrough of integrating AI into Kubernetes problem solving

Description: This is a short vid on the Sidecar pattern. Starts stong with a simple graphic illustration of a motorcycle sidecar, where the pattern gets its name from. The sidecar is a helper component, generally for logs/monitoring, service discovery or traffic routing. The idea is to seperate concerns, so your core app is only doing the business logic and the sidecar does the extra work. The sidecar is agnostic of language, so doesn't need to match the core logic's programming language. They go through many examples, including of mesh and scalability. They work through a number of scenarios, including using sidecar as proxies so that your app only talks to its sidecar, and the sidecar takes care of all the network related bits. They also contrast sidecars to the ambassador pattern, pointing out sidecars co-locate a process with your main service while ambassador creates a gateway or proxy in front of the service. To tie things up, we go through downsides, like extra resource usage, extra complexity and added latency in some requests. Overall, a great intro though.

Description: This article will explain what a Pod is in the Kubernetes sense. They explain that a Pod is the smallest unit of deployment, but that it is possible to deploy multiple containers to a single pod. Any pod members share IP address, network namespeace and storage volumes, and it enables them to communicate easily. We then enumerate through the various bits of a pod, including containers, storage, networking, labels and selectors and resource limits, each getting a paragraph. We then work through why pods are important, and they touch on deployments and rollback, scalability and consistency. We dip a toe into pod lifecycle, touching on the status a pod can be in, with a 1-2 sentence summary of each - pending, running, succeded, failed and unknown. To wrap things up, we touch on advanced features, like init containers, sidecars and pod disruption budgets. Actually a good quick intro.

They go through some of the components, with a short description - Edge module, the agent that works with eBPF to collect data; Vizier, which manages the edge modules; then others, like Cloud, CLI and client API. They have a chart for comparing to other monitoring tools. Now, we're into hardware and software prereqs. We then get into a step-by-step walkthrough on how to install. At step 9, for instance, we have the basic setup with a plethora of pods up and running. They then set up the client and go through a bunch of the visualizations that it shows. To me, the setup is cool but while the visuals are nice, I don't get a good sense of what I'm looking at, and I think that could be improved.

Description: This piece is going to talk about securing and cleaning Kubernetes clusters, primarily with Notary and AKS image cleaner. We start with a blurb about why we should always pull images, rather than only pulling images if we don't have them in our local cache. Then we move on to an explaination of Notary, which is a tool that verifies an image wasn't altered from when it was built. They include a way to add a signature and YAML to verify it. Next we look at the image cleaner, which simply figure out if an image is no longer used and deletes it. For Azure, it's as simple as adding it when we create the cluster; they also show how to verify it's active. They then tie this up to conclude. For me, I'm wondering what you do for existing clusters -- can this be added on the fly? Also, curious about avoiding the cache if you have a Notary signed image? While some flaws, it's an interesting perspective.

Description: The authors here claim that a good platform engineering effort should contain solid app security practices. They dive in with least privilege, which is how anything should operate. They also advocate for just in time permissions, where elevation only occurs as needed and is reliquished afterwords. Next up is secure defualts in the configuration, so that things are properly set up. This is because bad configs do cause a lot of security mishaps. We then look at CI/CD pipelines, where they advise to fail fast and fail safe. This means that security checks are done early and find issues before things are too far into the rollout. Finally, they advise to use GitOps for versioning and control, to automate and streamline as many processes as possible. My take is that I like their ideas, the truth is security is often rushed or ignored in development in the name of productivity, with no real concrete steps here to address that.
BottomLine: Good high-level discussion of how Platform engineering can be done in a security aware way to improve both

Description: This article talks about RBAC, and does it from a perspective that a dev cluster might have loose roles, but a prod one should have tighter security. We're going to have some hands on, so Minikube running is a prereq. After a quick primer on AA, they tell us about ABAC, RBAC and Node auth. We get a chart showing some roles, and what access is connected to those various roles. They mention that Pods don't have traditional users, but our Minikube uses a config file, and they show us the contents. They explain that based on a TLS certificate, K8s maps us to a user, as long as our cert is valid. They then walk through the process of making a cert - generate a key, do a signing request, generate a signed cert from the request, and then they verify the cert works. They do a bit more naviagation and verification to set things up, before switching to granting access to the created user. They show us the YAML file that has the perms, and then the YAML file that attaches perms to roles. After doing this, we test the actual roles. We are then shown the difference between namespaced roles and cluster roles. They then move on to service accounts, used for Java or Python apps. They then explain why we need them, and set up an account, and then verify they work. Actually a good little walk through.

We start out with misconfigs, with some paragraphs of examples and illustrations. Next we look at unauth access, like a role with too much permissions. They advocate for using the principle of least privilege, which is solid. They also advocate for changing defaults and removing permissive access. They touch on kubelet, networking and public exposed services. Next is vuln container images, where one of your dependencies in the supply chain has an issue. They talk about risks with using popular images or setting tags to "latest". Finally, there are network threats, and this is all just motivation for KSPM. Tools and techniques they advocat for are using RBAC correctly, implementing good Network Policies and utilizing MFA, multi factor auth. My take is that there is lots of worry and not enough managing of posture. Their suggestions are fine, but not super holistic and not much more than standard practices would suggest.

Description: Kubernetes is pretty awesome, but this article asks how we might address it from a disaster recovery (DR) perspective. They argue that because K8s has a different workload approach, any DR has to take this into account. They start with why we need DR for K8s before moving onto what the challenges with DR are. We have to understand the basic configs, and where things like the persistent volumes are stored. They do mention some K8s staples, like easily grabbed images, allow apps to be run almost anywhere. They do look at things like the manifests which create containers, as these are the key pieces in getting things working. They advise focusing on getting parts of the K8s cluster working, as those may contain the critical business functions. This allows resumption of the core business first, and then allows time to return less crtical systems to health. They also mention looking at Kubernetes-aware tools.

We then dive into what makes Kubernetes expensive - DevOps time, adding services (like Load bals), managed services and costs of K8s wrappers. Each of these get a paragraph of explaination. Now, our hero "Cycle" shows up to save us money -- this is our sponsor, I'd assume. It apparently improves infra density, reduces DevOps time and empowers enginneers.

Description: We start with an alphabet soup of regulations that require User access reports; even though users should rarely if ever have access to much of Kubernetes. Apparently these are supposed to be done periodically, and the reports flow to auditors. Oddly, they pose these reports as "what users have access to" as opposed to what they actually accessed. They argue these reports help with identifying unauth access and monitoring for sensitive resources -- but without explaining what the reports contain. While some of the points they are making are fair, without knowing what a "report" contains it may or may not address what they are after. A bit further in they state that their tool centralizes user access -- but is it a reporting tool or an auth tool? Up until now, I felt it was an audit/reporting tool. They then talk about reports. My take is it's a great topic, just done in a weird approach here.

Next up, we're told that Kubernetes attacks are growing, and many of them stem from misconfigs. They claim that attackers can take advantage in minutes and traditional security tools can take days to detect this. Next, they claim that alert-based systems aren't enough, since they generate many alerts and need manual intervention. It seems the "goal" is real-time threat detection. The claim here is that it not only detects but also remediates in real time, without explaining how this is done. There is a bit of handwaving about KSPM and how realtime detection is important, but other than a couple screenshots of the dashboard, there are no details on how this is done. My take is this is an interesting area, but you need to explain what the tools are doing, not wave a magic wand.

It's concise and does a good job of explaining Cilium
BottomLine: Good intro and setup walkthrough of Cilium for Kubernetes

DateReviewed: 2024-10-20
Description: In a compliment to "shift left", shift down pushes security earlier into the dev process allowing security to be addressed more completely. The idea is that developers play a more active role, using risk assessment and things like cloud native tools to be more secure. Shift down targets things like runtime and monitoring, cover cloud infra, and things like 3rd party libs. They advise to use things like automated policy enforcement, more observability and response, and security optimization without dev friction. Finally they compare shift down with CNAPP, an alternative approach. This is an interesting paper with cool approaches.
BottomLine: Intro to interesting new security approach for Kubernetes developers

DateReviewed: 2024-10-20
Description: We start with a blurn about KubeLB, which is a Kubernetes Load balancer. Has a brief para explaining the audience and target for the product, which seems aimed at mid-sized providers and shops with a mix of in cloud and on prem systems. It has a diagram but not much actual technical detail, so this is more of a marketing promo then an actual dive into the system.
BottomLine: Marketing info lacking any actual tech info - skip

DateReviewed: 2024-10-21
Description: This is more of a short essay then a formal article. It's more of a philisophical approach than hard ideas, but it's a good think piece. Short and sweet, I'd recommend for a quick read.
BottomLine: Short piece on approaches to optimization - high level and recommended

DateReviewed: 2024-10-21
Description: An exam of the Kubernetes infra on Digital Ocean. Starts with a diagram, always good -- it's basically a walkthrough of their systems and high level security approach. I'd say it's mostly to instill trust from customers, it's an interesting dive into how at least one provider does K8s security. It's not very long but pretty good overall - would be good to read to understand provider approaches.
BottomLine: Niche cloud provider approach to Kubernetes secrity - interesting to some people

URL reference: https://mogenius.com/blog-posts/best-practices-for-writing-kubernetes-yaml-manifests
DateReviewed: 2024-10-22
Description: This article talks about writing good YAML manifests. At first I thought it was going to be a bunch of fluff, but it is decent - they have solid advice, like using the latest stable API version to base your YAML off of. They have lots of tips and give good examples. It's a decent length, and talks about a topic that I haven't seen covered elsewhere and does it well. Recommended.
BottomLine: Great article on writing good YAML for Kubernetes

DateReviewed: 2024-10-22
Description: Our article tackles the challenges of working in a small environment. Specifically, he is using a VDI, and that constrains what can be run and how. He talks about using local tools (over CI/CD, which added 15mins/iteration) by using things like Vagrant. I'd like to have seen more on the env and usage, but this is where we're done.
BottomLine: Interesting topic but not much in the article

DateReviewed: 2024-10-23
Description: We start with Kubernetes good, and Ingress good, but must be secure. The issue is three paras in, I'm not sure if they are talking about outward facing or cluster facing security. We then go through a four-point checklist of why TLS is good, and I agree, and I think they mean it for external traffic. We finally arrive at the plug, and it is for a certificate issuer -- which is most valuable for non-controlled entities, like browsers. Decent topic, but a very muddled approach so I'd say skip it.
BottomLine: Skipable piece about a good topic - using TLS to secure Kubernetes Ingress

DateReviewed: 2024-10-23
Description: This one we jump right into, and it's an open source vuln scanner called Horusec. The idea is to plug it into your dev pipeline to get feedback early and fix security issues before they become a problem. There is a brief review of how it works - in your dev pipeline, it does static and dynamic testing, reports/alerts and allows customization. There is a walkthrough, so YAY! We start by installing, and then just doing a simple scan, and we walk through options like what directory to scan, what severity of issue to look for and which language we should focus on. They then show us a sample JSON and HTML report output. Actually well done!
BottomLine: Great intro and walkthrough to the Horusec scanner for DevOps and Kubernetes

DateReviewed: 2024-10-24
Description: This article argues that chat has been a tool in recent years that has helped devs communicate better - screenshares and copy/pasting code. The term ChatOps was coined by GitHub in 2013, and this allowed devs to manage the build process as a team. It took off for a while, before fading into an alternative, but around 2016 Cloud Native started to gain traction. Now we have ChatOps for Kubernetes. They use an example of an issue in off-hours occuring, and ChatOps translating that to the native comms tool to send alerts to team members. They say that the on-call person can use the chat app on their phone to monitor and debug the issue. They present a short laundry list of benefits from ChatOps, mainly being able to leverage things as a team from a single spot. They do mention that if a second person joins, all of the ChatOps commands are there, and that allows someone to see what has been done. It also allows live pairing for menotring. Our authors talk about a new took, Botkube, which they mention good integration with K8s and support for many chat programs.
BottomLine: Good article talking about ChatOps for Kubernetes and how it helps DevOps teams

DateReviewed: 2024-10-24
Description: This article dives into the issues surrounding configuration in a Kubernetes context. The author looked into this in 2017, and circled back and pruned the list to what was still supported. This ended up with 6 primary tools, with an additional list of smaller or up and coming tools. He does explain what the various tools are at a high level, and also does give their GitHub star rating which give some indication of how popular they are. It's a interesting discussion and intro to some tools.
BottomLine: Interesting toe-dip on a variety of Kubernetes related tools
