DateReviewed: 2025-04-01
Description: This article tackles the subject of running multiple containers in a single pod. We start with a bit one why - namely having closely-related containers run near each other - and a bit more motivation and background. They then run through what might cause us to need them to run near each other, and there are a few - tightly coupled apps, sidecar pattern, ambassador pattern and finally adapter pattern. They then go through the benefits - share resources, simplified management, better performance and easy comms. We then get into the nitty gritty of how, and as always it starts with YAML. They walk us through, with explaination, the needed snip of YAML. They then walk us through shared volumes, so that both containers can use the same file resources. We then get a section on best practices -- things like there should be a strong relation between the containers, and think about lifecycle, since they will both start and stop together. They even have a short section on when NOT to run containers together! Well done.
BottomLine: Excellent piece on how and when to run multiple containers on a single Kubernetes pod

Description: Our article today looks into smart contract deployment, which interfaces with the Blockchain and generally cryptocurrency actions. We start with a bit of Web3 background, and a bit about how our topic tool Kontract functions. They tout a shared dev env, abstraction of blockchain responsibilities, multi-network simultaneous development and Kubernetes-native integrations as benefits. At a high level, it lets you build a standard, repeatable, and scalable to multiple developers approach to your blockchain bits. To finish up, they to a walk-through of a real-world scenario.
BottomLine: Great intro to using a smart contract authoring tool on Kubernetes

Description: As usual, we start with a bit of background - Kubernetes is very popular, but security isn't always peak. Then we do a quick basics, and they include an excellent diagram. They remark that RBAC is a good building block, but note that misconfigs can hurt this. To illustrate, they walk us through a sample misconfig and show us how to exploit it. They show us this all in Curl through the web interface, and show how we can run a command through this. But that is it - no remediation or advice on how to avoid.
BottomLine: Good quick walkthrough of a simple misconfig exploit on Kubernetes

Description: Our article today will go beyond the default Kubernetes scheduler with its support for node affinity and will build a custom scheduler that allows more fine tuned placement. We start with an intro which gives some background. We then go through a primer of how K8s decides where it puts pods. There are three types of plugins - filter, score, and other - the filter figures out if a node is suitable for a pod; score ranks nodes that are eligible, another other actually handles stages of the scheduling. We then go through the prereqs to build the custom scheduler, which includes GO, K8s, Docker and the K8s CLI. They then do a step by step walk through of the process, defining the use case, implementing the plugin, integrating with the K8s scheduler, and running it. They then go through testing and validation. Very well done and clear.
BottomLine: Good clear walkthrough and motivation for a custom Kubernetes scheduler

Description: Today's article will tackle the who did what in your cluster - Kubernetes audit logs. We start with what are audit logs, where they go over what info we want to collect, and they lay it out well in "4 Ws". They are what happened, who did it, when did it happen, and where was it done. They explain a short issue and how logs help. We then go through why they are improtant, and talk about security, troubleshooting, compliance and transparency. We then dig into how audit logging works in K8s. Everything stats with the API server, but then they take us through the pipeline, which includes RequestRecieved, ResponseStarted, ResponseComplete and Panic if something goes wrong. Next they walk us through the steps of configuring logs - first they need to be enabled in the API server, then configured with an Audit Policy. Finally they talk a bit about how to analyze audit logs, and use a specific snip to highlight how. To close, they leave us with some best practices for logging.
BottomLine: A good all around overview of Audit logging for Kubernetes

DateReviewed: 2025-04-06
Description: This article is going to tackle some alternatives to VMware that are Kubernetes based. We start with a bit of background on VMs in general and VMware in paticular, and they tell us that people are looking at how K8s can do some of these types of things. One way is akin to lift and shift using CDRs to run the VMs. There are a few of these points, each supported by a solid paragraph of info for each point. Next we look at K8s platforms - OpenShift, SUSE Harvester, Spectro Cloud, KubeVirt on DIY K8s and finally Platform9. They include a chart for comparison. They do talk about storage issues, paticularly for persistent and stateful workloads, and a bit about scalability. They do a side quest to explain how their product, Portworx, solves these issues. They do explain that Portworx runs with any of the various platforms they mentioned. To wrap up, they do a real-world walkthrough of a certain use case to demonstrate things. 
BottomLine: Solid explaination of Kubernetes platforms and storage options to replace VMware

DateReviewed: 2025-04-07
Description: Our article today focuses on an app called Things and how it switched to Swift and Kubernetes. We start with a bit of background, and what Things is, namely a personal task manager. They use Things Cloud as they backend, to sync todos and whatnot between devices. The app has 12 yrs of longevity, but needed a refresh on the tech level. They tell us they were using Python 2 and Google App engine; but this had limitations and needed an upgrade. They thought about using Java, Python 3, GO and even C++, but settled on Swift. They had concerns about Swift's use as a server, but thought there was strong commitment from Apple and the community. The give us a diagram and an overview of how the bits fit together. They break things down into code, deployment, storage, other services, and monitoring. They then run through the results - the response time is faster and costs are cheaper than before, with a modern tooling to boot.
BottomLine: Good walkthrough of migrating from one system to a modern Cloud Native system

Description: This article is a high level overview to a paper on Shift Down security. It links to the paper, and explains that it is trying to motivate adoption of things like Policy as Code to prevent misconfigs. They also include some quotes from key people, to explain and help promote the paper.
BottomLine: Short article announcing the Shift Down paper and Policy as Code effort for Kubernetes

Description: Our article of interest today is on the ultimate DevOps roadmap - and it promises to be good, as it is on Tech by Nana's site. We start with a bit of grounding - there are lots of tools, but we'll break things down. We dive in with DevOps basics, and this starts as stps with things like embrace automation, version control systems and CI/CD, each explained with a short paragraph. We then touch on Containers and Orchestration, again with a brief para. We're then linked to a couple of 1 hr courses on Docker and Kubernetes, which I assume go over the basics. Step 5 is then Cloud platforms, where she talks about AWS, Azure and Google cloud. We then pivot to our *personal* knowledge - and we look at first leveling up our skills, to second getting some hands on experience with a CI/CD project, and finally Connect and Collaborate with groups and forums that allow you to participate. So, my perspective is that it's a good baseline, but it would have helped to delegate a bit less and explain a bit more in the article. Still, a solid resource.
BottomLine: Solid beginner resource to getting started in DevOps
