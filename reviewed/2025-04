Description: This article tackles the subject of running multiple containers in a single pod. We start with a bit one why - namely having closely-related containers run near each other - and a bit more motivation and background. They then run through what might cause us to need them to run near each other, and there are a few - tightly coupled apps, sidecar pattern, ambassador pattern and finally adapter pattern. They then go through the benefits - share resources, simplified management, better performance and easy comms. We then get into the nitty gritty of how, and as always it starts with YAML. They walk us through, with explaination, the needed snip of YAML. They then walk us through shared volumes, so that both containers can use the same file resources. We then get a section on best practices -- things like there should be a strong relation between the containers, and think about lifecycle, since they will both start and stop together. They even have a short section on when NOT to run containers together! Well done.
BottomLine: Excellent piece on how and when to run multiple containers on a single Kubernetes pod

Description: Our article today looks into smart contract deployment, which interfaces with the Blockchain and generally cryptocurrency actions. We start with a bit of Web3 background, and a bit about how our topic tool Kontract functions. They tout a shared dev env, abstraction of blockchain responsibilities, multi-network simultaneous development and Kubernetes-native integrations as benefits. At a high level, it lets you build a standard, repeatable, and scalable to multiple developers approach to your blockchain bits. To finish up, they to a walk-through of a real-world scenario.
BottomLine: Great intro to using a smart contract authoring tool on Kubernetes
