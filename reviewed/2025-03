Description: Our article today is going to compare Kubernetes to a Docker product called Swarm. We start with an intro paragraph, and jump into What is Kubernetes, with a quick overview and a decent diagram. We have some point form that list the advantages and challenges of Kubernetes. Next up, we have a what is Docker Swarm section, that has an overview and a diagram too, before another point form section with pros and cons of Swarm. We then pivot to a head to head comparison, looking at install and setup, scaling, load balancing, and ecosystem. They are quick compares, but are good comparion points. They even give some broad recommendations!
BottomLine: Good quick comparison of Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm as container engines
