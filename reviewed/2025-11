Description: This article talks a bit about the Policy Working Group, the Kubernetes community org dedicated to K8s policies. This article gives an overview and a bit of an outline on the work, with a link to an interview with the group members.
BottomLine: Interesting insight into how Policies are approached by the Kubernetes community

Description: Today's article is a bit of a unicorn - long, in depth, and pretty well written. We start with a short intro, where they explain how they'll tackle this subject. They start with a multi-para on what is K8s arch, the big picture overview, before diving into the cluster as a foundation and looking at how they work. After a bit more on clusters, we pivto to Control Plane components, where they outline the various bits in dives and then explain how they work together. We next look at worker node components, and they look at what makes that up and how they fit into the K8s arch. They look at pods, do a deep dive into how applications run on K8s, and talk about differences between workers and control nodes, before including a small pitch for their visual manager tool.
BottomLine: Very good walkthrough of many of the pieces of Kubernetes

Description: This is a hands-on lab, where you add health reports in to your microservices. It has a linked Git repo, and ways to do the exercises on Window, Mac and Linux. It has a couple ways to run the lab, including on the webpage, which is pretty cool. Recommended.
BottomLine: Lab which shows you how to add health reports to microservices

DateReviewed: 2025-11-04
Description: So, this is not actually the article, but a three paragraph summary of the article, which does sound interesting. They talk about the fact that namespacs and the Kubernetes approach to workload isolation is decent but not perfect -- there are holes that errant apps can fall into, causing performance issues and more. It appears they propose an alternative, but since the linked article is sign-in only, we don't know.
BottomLine: Interesting topic but only a summary linking to a sign in wall

DateReviewed: 2025-11-05
Description: Today's article talks about replik8s, an open source tool while allows users to clone their cluster (log) data to do analysis on it. We start with a bit of background on the company, and then they explain how their original use case was to capture data from diverse sources for future queries. They do a bit of a walkthrough, starting with what they call snapshots, which is the process to grab data from a Kubernetes cluster. You can then serve the data, which functions as a "mirror" of the data collected in the snapshot for interrogation. You can query with Kubernetes tools, or use tools that would work against a K8s cluster, like Trivy. They have a way, through multiple snapshots, to allow an MCP server to interact with an AI to look into changes over time. Last but not least,  you can visualize the data with a web-based "notebook" to allow easy looks into the whole cluster. Interesting tool.
BottomLine: Intro and brief walkthrough of new open source Replik8s tool for Kubernetes logging and API data

Description: This article dives into how to set up MCP servers for allowing access into services for AI. First we get a bit of background on the author and how this idea came to them, from sessions they do. For this piece, they look at the challenge that doing a podcast and publishing it cause, and how automation or AI could help. They outline all of the steps they do, and explain a lot of them are manual bits of work to do. For one task, they used AI to summarize and produce show notes and social media drafts, which origianlly took a lot of time to do. They mention they still do more edits before using them, but getting the base stuff done is much faster. They one issue was that it only helped THEM, and not their collabs who did other episodes. They first thought about an ideal approach, but then settled into a more practical one, of using MCP along side Gemini CLI, which they already used. And the Podcast assistant MCP is born. They note that the original tool did all steps in sequence, but the MCP tool can do any step at any time, meaning you can omit steps (like using a manual show notes if you have it). This boils down to 4 functions, which in the end produce draft show notes and social media posts for review. They then talk about deployment and various considerations, including security. The idea is to have a workflow that works. Good read.
BottomLine: Walkthrough of using MCP and AI to complete a practical task

DateReviewed: 2025-11-07
Description: The article on tap today looks at secret management in the enterprise context. They explain tha by using K8s in a large enterprise, it can quickly turn into a nightmare, having to manage the secrets for all apps in a secure way. Add in things like rotation and having to abide by proper govenance policies, it can be prohibitive. After a bit more background, we get to the actual proposals - things like an external secrets operator, automatic rotation, and fine grained access control policies, among many others. They recommend using an integrated platform, for ease of use and consistency. They claim this can cut security incidents and save time and money. Interesting piece.
BottomLine: Article on issues surrounding Enterprise secrets in Kubernetes and how to approach them
