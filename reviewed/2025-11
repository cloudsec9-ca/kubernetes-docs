Description: Today's article is a bit of a unicorn - long, in depth, and pretty well written. We start with a short intro, where they explain how they'll tackle this subject. They start with a multi-para on what is K8s arch, the big picture overview, before diving into the cluster as a foundation and looking at how they work. After a bit more on clusters, we pivto to Control Plane components, where they outline the various bits in dives and then explain how they work together. We next look at worker node components, and they look at what makes that up and how they fit into the K8s arch. They look at pods, do a deep dive into how applications run on K8s, and talk about differences between workers and control nodes, before including a small pitch for their visual manager tool.
BottomLine: Very good walkthrough of many of the pieces of Kubernetes

DateReviewed: 2025-11-04
Description: So, this is not actually the article, but a three paragraph summary of the article, which does sound interesting. They talk about the fact that namespacs and the Kubernetes approach to workload isolation is decent but not perfect -- there are holes that errant apps can fall into, causing performance issues and more. It appears they propose an alternative, but since the linked article is sign-in only, we don't know.
BottomLine: Interesting topic but only a summary linking to a sign in wall

DateReviewed: 2025-11-05
Description: Today's article talks about replik8s, an open source tool while allows users to clone their cluster (log) data to do analysis on it. We start with a bit of background on the company, and then they explain how their original use case was to capture data from diverse sources for future queries. They do a bit of a walkthrough, starting with what they call snapshots, which is the process to grab data from a Kubernetes cluster. You can then serve the data, which functions as a "mirror" of the data collected in the snapshot for interrogation. You can query with Kubernetes tools, or use tools that would work against a K8s cluster, like Trivy. They have a way, through multiple snapshots, to allow an MCP server to interact with an AI to look into changes over time. Last but not least,  you can visualize the data with a web-based "notebook" to allow easy looks into the whole cluster. Interesting tool.
BottomLine: Intro and brief walkthrough of new open source Replik8s tool for Kubernetes logging and API data

Description: This article dives into how to set up MCP servers for allowing access into services for AI. First we get a bit of background on the author and how this idea came to them, from sessions they do. For this piece, they look at the challenge that doing a podcast and publishing it cause, and how automation or AI could help. They outline all of the steps they do, and explain a lot of them are manual bits of work to do. For one task, they used AI to summarize and produce show notes and social media drafts, which origianlly took a lot of time to do. They mention they still do more edits before using them, but getting the base stuff done is much faster. They one issue was that it only helped THEM, and not their collabs who did other episodes. They first thought about an ideal approach, but then settled into a more practical one, of using MCP along side Gemini CLI, which they already used. And the Podcast assistant MCP is born. They note that the original tool did all steps in sequence, but the MCP tool can do any step at any time, meaning you can omit steps (like using a manual show notes if you have it). This boils down to 4 functions, which in the end produce draft show notes and social media posts for review. They then talk about deployment and various considerations, including security. The idea is to have a workflow that works. Good read.
BottomLine: Walkthrough of using MCP and AI to complete a practical task

DateReviewed: 2025-11-07
Description: The article on tap today looks at secret management in the enterprise context. They explain tha by using K8s in a large enterprise, it can quickly turn into a nightmare, having to manage the secrets for all apps in a secure way. Add in things like rotation and having to abide by proper govenance policies, it can be prohibitive. After a bit more background, we get to the actual proposals - things like an external secrets operator, automatic rotation, and fine grained access control policies, among many others. They recommend using an integrated platform, for ease of use and consistency. They claim this can cut security incidents and save time and money. Interesting piece.
BottomLine: Article on issues surrounding Enterprise secrets in Kubernetes and how to approach them

Description: Our article postulates about secret security with the adoption of Kubernetes to deploy to. After a bit of background, we're down to brass tacks - why does secret mgmt need attention? They point out older practices like hardcoded creds or hand-rotated ones aren't keeping up with today's envs. They point out how things can be risky, and explain it's our job to manage such risk. What they advance to help with this is the Secrets store CSI Driver, which allows secrets to be stored in an extrenal store. It checks all the boxes - encryption, rotation, granualar access and audit logging. They give some real world example use cases, talk strategic benefits before finishing up with talking about security as scale.
BottomLine: Interesting approach to secret security on Kubernetes

Description: Today's article does a dive into deploying MCP securely on Kubernetes. They talk about the Model Context Protocol, how it began and point out the issues it can have as background. They talk about using WASM to mitigate risks, and show us a diagram of dataflows. This is a walkthrough, so they start with the bits we'll need to get this working, including NodeJS, NPM and wash. We need also to grab a plugin, the OpenAPI2MCP connector, to have things happen. They go through setting up our dev area we will connect MCP to, generate the configs, and finally dig into the MCP server. We spin up the MCP server, and then we connect to a model so we can get work done. They use Goose as the client, which can conect to a lot of models, and explain how ngrok is set up to forward locally. You have to configure Goose, which they talk about, and when that is done, we are ready to go. We can then ask a question and the model will return an answer. Now that this is done, we can publish and make available our model as an OCI image. They then show how to do this, so anyone can ask your model questions.
BottomLine: Great walkthrough of setting up AI to MCP securely on Kubernetes

Description: At first, I misunderstood what this was - I thought it was an MCP server for general use, but wouldn't make changes to the far end; but it's actually a Kubernetes MCP, that allows you to get insight into your K8s cluster without worrying that the model will update your deployed workloads. It does everything you'd think, like getting pods/nodes/resources, and it doesn't depend on kubectl. Supports namespaces and all kinds of bells and whistles. Installs a bunch of different ways, including NPM and Docker image, and just needs a basic config to get going. Interesting tool.
BottomLine: Repo for a tool to use AI to inspect your running Kubernetes cluster in a read-only way

DateReviewed: 2025-11-11
Description: Today's article talks about Zero Trust Kubernetes and using webhooks to help with security and multi-tenancy. The focus here is on Admission webhooks, and what we can do with them to ensure that workloads conform to what we expect before launching them. They talk about validating and mutating controllers, that let you check and possibly change what is going to be run. They advocate partnering this with Kyverno and OPA gatekeeper so you have Policy as code and a YAML policy engine to help you out. They lay out a number of solid policies you should consider rolling out in your cluster. They even do a diagram of how things work, tracing a request through the API server and onto the Zero-trust webhook controller before it gets sent to a Kubernetes pod for fullfillment. They have a 5 step walkthrough, with YAML snips included, to get things set up. Finally they have a section on Multi-tenant and shared envs, including YAML snips before closing off with best practices. Good read.
BottomLine: Interesting article on setting up workload security on Kubernetes with admission controllers

Description: This is a blog entry on the newest version of the actualbudget chart. Truth be told, I thought these charts were to keep your Kubernetes cluster costs under control, but it's actually for a home focused budgeting software package which looks very slick. The bump here is aimed at bringing the Helm managed deployment to the very latest version. Quite neat, will try it.

DateReviewed: 2025-11-13
Description: This is a great hands-on story about the pitfalls about carefully planning but not seeing something and the effect of that biting you. Our story starts simply, where the author is migrating from IAM users to SSO on AWS; they were even careful, and noted they disabled the IAM users for about a month before deleting them, to ensure things were all working as expected. The wrinkle was that they had used KMS, and the key was tied to one of the now deleted IAM users. He thought he had a solution -- blow away the existing Key and let TF recreate it, and he got no errors, so success, right? Turns out there is a restriction here, so he'd actually need to get access back to the KMS keys. Reaching out to AWS support, there were some hoops (and manual juggling) needed to get things working. The end result is that he noted he needed to do the KMS key bits BEFORE deleting the IAM users - lesson learned. Good story.
BottomLine: Awesome narration of an odd issue with a small improvement and how it was resolved

DateReviewed: 2025-11-14
Description: I kinda love this article; it's about stuff that can go wrong in Kubernetes and how to try to avoid it. After a bit of background, we dive into the meat, and it has a format - the pitfall, a bit of context, how to avoid it, and a short my reality check to give you assurance. The seven things that can bite you are - skipping resource requests/limits, using liveness and readiness probes right, relying on container logs, treating dev and prod the exact same, leaving old stuff around, diving too deep into networking stuff too soon, and finally, going too light on security and RBAC. Love the practical perspective on this.
BottomLine: Great article on common things that bite us using Kubernetes
