Description: In our intro, we learn logs are good -- but how can we access them, especially in crashed or currently running pods? Oh, I like it, our author is going through commands, and he's taking us through from first principles. We are shown how to find a pod of interest, how to see the logs and how to view them in real time, along with all of the above in a namespace. You can use a flag to see a recent run, and how to choose a specific container in a multi-container pod. And that is the walkthrough -- short and sweet, and decently done.
BottomLine: Hands on quick walk through on Kubernetes log commands

Description: For the intro, we're going to leverage K8s features to do something neat. The author is looking at using canaries with weights or possibly route based deployments from ingress to do something a bit different. They share that usually we see either ephemeral containers or copies to find issue -- but their idea is to use a different container runtime for debugging. They are using the Kata runtime for this, instead of the default runc. They even talk about a scenario where Kata can provide isolation if there is a security issue that isn't immediately patchable. And, they have a good diagram showing the two use cases. They then run through the YAML to show how the config would look, and how to set up the canaries to split traffic. Overall, an interesting article.
BottomLine: Innovative look at using canaries for isolation and debugging in Kubernetes

Description: Intro explains that a new cryptojacking attack was discovered that targets Kubernetes and docker. We then visit a definition of Cyptojacking, and then dive in to the hack. It uses a Python script to install curl and add a periodic command to the system, and it is named after the control domain, which is a variation of "kiss-a-dog". A number of hiding techniques are used to obfuscate the code, the processes, and the goal -- which is to mine Crypto and send the mined hashes to servers under the control of the jackers. A good walk through.
BottomLine: A high-level walk through of a cryptojacker targeting Kubernetes and Docker

Description:  Our into goes regular places - K8s is awesome, but ... security; so they are going to take us through RBAC here. We dive right in, and explain how RBAC basically works in one sentence. They then break this down, explaining each of Authentication, Authorization, and Admission control in a short paragraph or two, and how they work together to form a permission scheme. Next we dive into RBAC rules, including a YAML example. They explain how the API group, the verb (action) and target (resource) form a rule. We then get some examples in YAML with explanations of what is going on. We then touch on 5 best practices, many of which are just good security practices. We then appraoch "day 2" ops, including review of RBAC as deployed. They point out that each K8s cluster is an island perms management wise, and it's not always easy to understand how roles are used.They then enumerate these 4 issues with multi-cluster management. They do pitch Armo as a possible solution, as the article seems sponsored by them.
BottomLine: Good intro to RBAC for Kubernetes

Description: Intro talks about 3 email related attacks on Microsoft 365, a cloud service many companies use. In this case, the attacker leverages email rules to hide info they don't want the victims to see. It seems that the attacker gains contol over the targeted account by an undisclosed mechanism. They go through how they determine a compromise, show the installed rule, and finally explain how they remediated the issue. The MO seems similar for all 3 attacks, but only the last attack seems to have a specific target -- to allow for invoice manipulation and ultimately allow the attackers to get monies paid to them by the victim company. A weakness is there isn't any suggestion on how to prevent this, only a wave to "buy our product" to detect it.
BottomLine: Good illustration of ways attackers can compromise Cloud services

Description: We start with a blurb about how k8s is customizable, and this is mainly done through plugins. Then we do a definition of what a K8s plugin is - an extension to the kubectl command. We are then introduced to a plugin manager of sorts, krew, which helps us to install and manage plugins. We then start going through the plugin tools. They do this with a link, a short blurb on what the plugin does, and some inline snippets to show how to use the plugin. There are a variety of plugins covered, in the network, secrets, and cluster management areas. At the end, they do a quick walkthrough of a shell-based plugin if you want to author one yourself. 
BottomLine: Good intro to Kubernetes security related plugins

Description: In a familiar intro, Docker is not secure by default, and containers are ephemeral and dynamic. We are then presented with a table with 8 risk categories, along with description, example and mitigation columns. After the chart, we are presented with best practices. After a short blurb, we get another table with the name of the practice and a description for keeping Docker secure at a host and daemon level. Finally, another motivating blurb for the last table to give us best practices for securing Docker images and containers. Now, I appreciate the thought here, but I think that this could have been better strucured. As is, I think pros might get it, but managers will be lost.
BottomLine: Decent high level quick walkthrough of Docker security issues

Description: Our intro touts both K8s and AI/GPT, and the company our author works for is integrating GPT into K8s. We're treated to a couple more paras of how GPT is awesome helping out with K8s, and then they have some examples. Apparently it's integrated as a GUI button, and allows interactive questions to be asked, like "how to I create a Pod". They call their integration "Doctor", and it leverages another one of their products which surfaces log info, which allows it to give tailored suggestions. Confusingly, while it seems the doctor and do some recommendation-based commands, it can't do simple things like spinning up a pod. No, wait -- it seemingly doesn't do that. Did no one proofread this copy? While this seems like a neat thing to try, the info is very high level and not very helpful. This is a case a video or walkthrough would have helped a lot.
BottomLine: High level GPT product pitch which seems a bit confused.

Description: Great short intro - OWASP top 10 helps identify most likely risks. They follow that up with background on the the various lists and how they are ordered. Next they talk about the K8s top 10, and how moving from on-prep to the cloud changes our approach. They include a color-coded diagram, which has all of the top 10 along with where in your K8s cluster they are a concern. They divide the list into three areas - misconfigs, missing visibility and vulnerability management. They then do a dive through each list item, with a diagram to tie it together, on the issue that it can cause and some mitigations. There are also some external refs, if you need background or motivation. It's pretty well done and goes into a decent amount of detail. One nitpick - a donut diagram to enumerate supply chain image issues uses similar cyan colors for 3 categories.
BottomLine: Good high level but detailed walkthrough of an approach to using OWASP K8s top 10 as a tool to secure your cluster

Description: We start this vid with a layout of how the sandbox works -- it is a local version running off another cluster with a special route. Our presenter  then fires up the environment locally which connets to the cluster, and he walks us through the code he's demoing, a lightweight ride sharing app. He then walks us through a YAML file which will connect the local env to the cluster. To get the special routing, he adds a header to the HTTP request. He then shows it work against his local version and then changes something to produce an odd return value. Actually a neat way to do some troubleshooting and debugging.
BottomLine: Walk through on a way to sandbox some code in Kubernetes

DateReviewed: 2023-08-07
Description: Our intro points out while K8s is popular, it's not as easy as Docker, but using managed providers can cost $50+/mo. They argue at this cost, it's more economical to install it yourself but you have to figure out how to manage it. Their provider of choice is Infomaniak to try this one out, and note that they have an offer for 300CHF in the first 3 months. They walk through the UI to get the basics set up. We then work through a TF file to get Kubernetes up. They then run Terraform to create a management node and a worker node. To finish up, they do a cost comparison so you can see how much your as-deployed self managed cluster will be.
BottomLine: Good hands on walkthrough of a self managed cloud Kubernetes deployment along with cost comparison breakdown with a provider managed alternative

DateReviewed: 2023-08-08
Description: Into talks a tiny bit about Helm, and asks if it can be taken seriously. The author gives us a bit about Helm's origins, and then talks about a big issue -- application lifecycle management. They talk about some tools, but clearly they are looking to use Helm for app lifecycle mgmt. They handwave on Helm working with charts, but do explain there are lots of pre-made charts to use. As with all K8s stuff, Helm is not secure by default. So they have some recommendations, like linting and using a repo and storing them in Git. There are some more recommendations, but until they get to "sign your charts", they are all just good generic recommendations and not security related really. There is a good amount of discussion on how to do this and check it, so that is good. A bit later they recommend not using any old Helm charts, but checking (and verifying) them. Actually a decent discussion to think about k8s Helm chart security.
BottomLine: Good intro to Kubernetes Helm chart security

Description: Intro is 4 paragraphs, so on the longer side, and touches on the regular points -- K8s getting popular, security important, without security bad things happen -- so need to be secure. Then we talk a bit about new issues related to Kubernetes, and how to handle those vulnerabilities and risks. They mention a bunch of k8s stuff we need to do, but w/o context. Ah, back to first principles -- we have a few paras on "what is Kubernetes security", followed by more paras of "why is it important". They touch on the 4C's (Cloud, Cluster, Container and Code), and how controls tie in. They motivate this by touching base on how bad actors can exploit open issues. So, on to best practices! This includes using RBAC properly, 3rd party Auth for your API server, protecting etcd w/ TLS, Firewalls and encryption. We also explore isolation of K8s nodes, traffic monitoring, process whitelisting, enabling auditing and keeping K8s up to date. Overall a decent high-level walkthrough of all things Kubernetes security.
BottomLine: Decently thorough high level Kubernetes security walk through

Description: Our intro shows us the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS), and talks about using it's versions (1 & 2) from Kubernetes and Docker. They explain the first version was a stict request/response protocol, but which potentially exposes sensitive info to the instance from an unprivleged app, which is risky. To mitigate this, we can either turn off IMDS or move to version 2, which requires a token along with any data requests. They go through some demos, to show the exposure with v1 and how this is closed for v2 and also how to use the token to get a proper response from v2. They also have another bunch of recommendations to harden your worker nodes to minimize or eliminate security risks.

Description: Our intro is the threat of your Kubernetes cluster being hijacked. They back up their intro with an investigation which they found 60% of clusters belonging to over 350 orgs had some signs of malware or breach. They found two principal issues -- anon access and misconfiged kubectl. Their project lasted 3 months, and after an intial scan found 120 hosts, each week they found 20 new hosts exposed. They also point out that in addition to on-cloud secrets, clusters often have secrets related to Git or CI/CD or external services like Docker Hub. They then show some (redacted) demo data, and explain how the access they found allowed them to obtain sensitive information. They then go through the crypto campaigns, and detail how things can be exploited to gain access with some good diagrams. They wrap up by showing some mitigation techniques.
BottomLine: Good hands-on discussion of specific secuity issues with Kubernetes and how to mitigate them

Description: Our vid into is simple - stop using image tags for Docker images. We dive in to answer the question of why image tags are bad. He points out that we don't know which version we are getting, and worse, latest might not even be the most recent, as it's just a name. Now he gets pedantic, and says that image authors CAN update even version tags to point at new images, which is true; but I don't think reputable distros will do this. The solution, our presenter says, is image digests -- which are immutable. Now that we can guarantee our pulled images match, there is still an issue -- we don't really know for sure who created the digested images. So, we reach out to digital signatures. By signing, we know who created the image, and decide if we trust them. I think this is a good conversation starter on what we need in our software supply chain to improve security.

Description: Our author feels other treatments fail to cover a complete security review, so they hope this one does. It's actually a pretty beefy document, and while it doesn't deep dive into each tool, it does generally include a snippet and some links to go deeper. Our article has 6 main sections, where he goes through checking and config review, permissions, exposed services and inbound networking, vulnerability scanning and add-ons. I'd say this is a mid-level document -- not a high level overview, but not a low levele deep dive. It's a good process approach to security in a container and Kubernetes orchestration enviroment. Worth a skim to have perspective for sure.
BottomLine: Decent mid-level process approach to penetration testing a Kubernetes cluster

Description: Our intro goes to the usual spot that K8s is the place to be, and they want to tell us some tools that help in that journey. Weirdly, they list the tools in a chart and in a bullet point list, but thankfully they then go through them. They include kubectl, but it's built in, but okay. They then go through each tool with about 2 paragraphs per tool. They cover monitoring, tracing, notifications, backups, secrets, costs and multiple clusters. It's a good high level toe dip in each area.

DateReviewed: 2023-08-12
Description: Our intro starts by explaining how RBAC fits into a Kubernetes cluster. They point out one weakness of RBAC is not having a deny ability, so it isn't always obvious what perms a role has. To address this, the author mentions Konstellation to surface the different permissions a role might have. They explain which roles have risks associated with them, and how to find these permissions and how they can be exploited. They do a good job of explaining the permission, what this grants, how it can be abused, and how it can be detected. After going through a number of such perms, they have some recommendations to close and mitigate the issues. Overall well done.
BottomLine: A pretty thorough examination of RBAC permissions and the security consequences of granting them, as well as ways to find them being used

Description: Our intro starts with security as something important but not done well all the time; and Kubernetes security getting attention because its an up and comer. Our article then dives into security standards, and start with the CIS benchmark, and the tools that implement that. They mention PCI (payment) standards, and then explain what the standards do, which is break things into the 4C's as layers. The article then advances 5 steps needed to secure - config, image scans, network sec, running app control and audit and event logging. They then do a treatmeant of each step, with either an example or a YAML snippet, and have a good amount of diagrams. The guidance seems solid and its a good mid-level approaach. One thing I like is that in closing, they mention that security is an (iterative) process, showing that you can't just set and forget it.

Description: Ok, so this is a hands-on tutorial, so pretty cool. They start off by explaining what Prometheus does and how it works, with a detailed architecture diagram. They then show how to set this up in a diagram for Kubernetes. They start with some housekeeping, namely permissions and a namespace so your monitoring is logically separate from your other workloads. They then use a config map to put the config into the K8s cluster, instead of having it reside in the containers themselves, which allows us to update and simply restart the monitoring pod to pick up config changes. They then walk through the setup of the monitoring deployment, along with 2 methods to access depending on your needs. They then go through a few setups, and explain what you might want to do in prod to have this work. It's actually well written and seems clean.
