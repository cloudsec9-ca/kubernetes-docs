Description: So, this is a pre-reInvent roundup, to prep people for the annual AWS show. Seems there is a lot of pre-show action, with 511 announcements in the lead up. They break things up into a few overall areas, and then post a one paragraph blurb from AWS and their opinion on each. There are about 3 dozen of these, and I like the approach. Also included are a link to the original announcement and other links where appropriate. Well done.
BottomLine: A review of AWS announcements prior to reInvent
