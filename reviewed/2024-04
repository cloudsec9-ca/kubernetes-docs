Description: While containers are a great tool, sometimes we want to interact with the app or env in the container, to understand what is going on, because logs aren't always telling the whole story. Often being able to run a command or a shell helps, and Kubernetes does have that ability, which this article explores.  First they quickly explain what k8s exec is, and go through some of the top features, before showing the syntax usage. It's part of kubectl, and you have to supply the target pod name and the command you want to run. They do a bit of a walk through, so they create some pods and wait for them to come ready. First up they show the very useful interactive shell, where you can interact like being logged into the pod. Next, they show some one-off commands, which are run in the context of the pod to allow you to see what is going on. They run the date command, and then perplexingly an update command -- odd because best practice dictates your containers should be immutable. They then show getting the env and setting an env variable, as well as running as a specific user. A use I haven't seen before is forwarding a pod port to your local machine. They also show how to access a second container in the same pod. They then have a few paragraphs on access restrictions and ensuring things are done in a secure manner.
BottomLine: Good intro to Kubernetes exec and some of its capabilities
