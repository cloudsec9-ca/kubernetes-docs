Description: Blog post on running Rancher Kubernetes engine on a bare metal setup. We start with a walk through what RKE (Rancher K8s engine) is, and how it differs, including better defaults, US Fed. Gov't standards compliance and continuous vulnerability monitoring. They talk also about it's lineage, where it gets simplicity as a K3s derivative, and how they have shifted away from relying on Docker. They note setting up a proper amount of memory and disk space is crucial or you can run into issues with your K8s master. They also note that MetalLB doesn't work with many cloud providers, as they don't support its networking requirements, but it will work with VirtualBox. Next we move onto installing RKE2, which has a laundry list of prereqs and then we have to fetch, install and enable the rke2 service. Next we start the service and confirm its running by checking the logs. We do a couple kubectl commands and ensure our K8s is up. Next, we set up the worker nodes, which includes many of the above steps with the additional step of using the master token to join the existing cluster. Next we install the load balancer and configure it, with a test service to ensure it is working. We then move on to setting up storage with Rook-Ceph. We go through pre-reqs, install, create a storage cluster then make it available. There are a lot of moving parts here, and I think think it would have been better to break it into a few parts; but it is a solid intro to the pieces.
BottomLine: Deploy Rancher Kubernetes to bare metal with LB and Storage

Description: This is just a stub for the bigger "State of Kubernetes security in 2024", which RedHat does every year. It does link to a brief blog overview, which is what I'll review here. It gives an executive summary, with three charts and a feeling of what the surveyed participants feel are the tough parts of Kubernetes security today. It's good because it's a real world survey, and not someone's feelings on what should be where. It's a good toe dip.
BottomLine: Overview of the annual State of Kubernetes security.
