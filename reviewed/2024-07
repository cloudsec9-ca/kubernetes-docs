Description: Blog post on running Rancher Kubernetes engine on a bare metal setup. We start with a walk through what RKE (Rancher K8s engine) is, and how it differs, including better defaults, US Fed. Gov't standards compliance and continuous vulnerability monitoring. They talk also about it's lineage, where it gets simplicity as a K3s derivative, and how they have shifted away from relying on Docker. They note setting up a proper amount of memory and disk space is crucial or you can run into issues with your K8s master. They also note that MetalLB doesn't work with many cloud providers, as they don't support its networking requirements, but it will work with VirtualBox. Next we move onto installing RKE2, which has a laundry list of prereqs and then we have to fetch, install and enable the rke2 service. Next we start the service and confirm its running by checking the logs. We do a couple kubectl commands and ensure our K8s is up. Next, we set up the worker nodes, which includes many of the above steps with the additional step of using the master token to join the existing cluster. Next we install the load balancer and configure it, with a test service to ensure it is working. We then move on to setting up storage with Rook-Ceph. We go through pre-reqs, install, create a storage cluster then make it available. There are a lot of moving parts here, and I think think it would have been better to break it into a few parts; but it is a solid intro to the pieces.
BottomLine: Deploy Rancher Kubernetes to bare metal with LB and Storage

Description: This is just a stub for the bigger "State of Kubernetes security in 2024", which RedHat does every year. It does link to a brief blog overview, which is what I'll review here. It gives an executive summary, with three charts and a feeling of what the surveyed participants feel are the tough parts of Kubernetes security today. It's good because it's a real world survey, and not someone's feelings on what should be where. It's a good toe dip.
BottomLine: Overview of the annual State of Kubernetes security.

Description: BunkerWeb is a WAF (web application firewall) that is open source. They start with a quick overview, then a seven part segment on why, with each point being about a paragraph. They then do a rundown of the various security features, and finally go through resources, which includes a demo version to test out, a cloud variant, a paid Pro version and consulting services, and a long list of community focused resources and documentation. Looks very interesting.
BottomLine: A new open source WAF with cloud ability called BunkerWeb

Description: This article discusses installing a comprehensive logging tool called Loki. We start with a diagram and there are a couple in here, which is always a good sign. They start with going through three variations of logging, monolithic, simple scalable and microservice, with a broken out explaination for each variant. It then goes through how the log bits work, tracing down both the write and read path for logging. Now we get into the install - so we add the repo in a helm CLI command, and then drop the YAML configs to be able to run the software. They then go through the YAML in chunks, explaining the various bits and what they do, and some of the options that are available. Once our config is ready, we can actually run the install to get things set up. This is the backend; they also run through how to set up and connect the client to send the logs. Pretty decent setup walkthrough.
BottomLine: Walkthrough install and basic info on the Grafana Loki Kubernetes logging piece.
