Description: Our article today is a humorous take on you have built a compiler, where we poke fun at using a simple way to do what another tech does, but as you need more features you rebuild the other tech, just worse and way less maintainably.
BottomLine: Good joking letter on why you shouldn't rebuild Kubernetes again

Description: Today's article is on Kubernetes add ons and making them secure. After a bit of background, we get into what Kubernetes add ons are and why they matter. They talk about Kubernetes base and what K8s does when it starts, and then it talks about the required add-ons like CNI and DNS, and then dipping into the optional things like TLS and Ingress among other things. Then we move into the security side, explaining that add ons are often run with more privs. They make the point that an addon with a security issue can lead to an easier compromise for attackers. They do talk about why it is hard to keep add ons updated - compatibility, lack of rollbacks, and set it and forget it among others. They then talk about the issues that people had with K8s upgrades in the past, and a bit about how this is improving. They have great suggestions - bring the pain forward, using open source tools to automate the boring stuff. They also advocate using a staged approach and doing it more often, before wrapping up.
BottomLine: A good discussion on security around Kubernetes add ons

DateReviewed: 2025-09-03
Description: What we're looking at today is a friendly guide to Kubernetes network policies. We start with a bit of background, before digging into what Kubernetes network policies actually are. They go through concepts like what a network policy is, what selectors are, and what ingress and egress rules are. Next we look at how to craft the policies as YAML files, going through 3 examples before summing up. Good compact intro.
BottomLine: Solid intro to Netowrk Policies in Kubernetes with YAML examples

DateReviewed: 2025-09-04
Description: This article is about quick security fixes to Kubernetes issues that occur all the time. We start with a short intro, and then dive right into the issues. The format is to list the issue, what the security badness is around it, and a one-line fix to it is in YAML format. The concerns include running pods as root, allowing priv. access, using "latest" tag in Prod, and hardcoding secrets. Good appraoch and execution.
BottomLine: Good walkthrough of simple security concerns in Kubernetes and quick fixes

Description: Today's article will look at Yoke, a possible replacement for Helm as a resource deployment system. We start with a short intro, we dive into the differences between them. They both map inputs to outputs basically, but the differences is that Helm uses Go to convert the templates to resources; they point out things like type disagreement. Yoke uses WebAssembly, which means anything that can produce a WA output can be used to write it. Where Helm calls the templates "charts", Yoke uses "flights". They also point out that Yoke can use Helm, because Go can be compiled to WA. The interesting thing is that a flight is a full program that writes resources to stdout. It does go through a code demo in Go using Yoke. Interesting project.
BottomLine: New project with a new take on Helm for Kubernetes called Yoke

Description: Our article today is the transcript of an interview about Kubernetes add ons security. There is a linked YouTube video, and they are going through a number of good topics, but they also include here some good diagrams or bits of good advice for your cluster, like knowing what you are running and staying current, for instance. 
BottomLine: Good interview over various bits of Kubernetes and add on security

Description: This is a toe dip into the area of Policy as Code as it applies to Kubernetes, and this is part 2 of 3. There's a bit of background before starting to talk about Cloud Native PaC, where they talk about various things like identity providers and runtime security among others. They surface a few tools like Kyverno and OPA with a bit of explaination. They then dive into PaC in Kubernetes, and look at it down to the YAML snip level. We then get a peek at the Maturity model, before wrapping up and giving some reading recommendations.
BottomLine: Interesting article about Policy as Code applied to Kubernetes

Description: Our article today focuses on AI network configuration. We start with a bit of background, looking at various things like demands for high speed and complexity of all the pieces of the network. To solve this, our authors pose Hedgehog as the solution. One of the things they mention is doing all of this in a multi-tenant setup, which can complicate things. We then dig into how Hedgehog approaches this - first, with a low-level "wiring" diagram, where you describe through YAML how the physical topology is set up. Next is what they call Operational Abstraction, which uses YAML to partition using VPCs to have multiple tenants. We then do a feature tour, looking at things like Automated provisioning and lifecycle management, simplified multi-tennant and intelligent peering, and monitoring and troubleshooting to close things up. An interesting product.
BottomLine: Intro and a bit of pitch for a new net mgmt player in the Kubernetes space

DateReviewed: 2025-09-10
Description: This is a CVE advisory about the Kubernetes Image Builder, a process used to create Windows containers. On certain providers, the image build process used hard coded creds which allowed root access. The vuln is limited, as at the conclusion of the build these containers are destroyed, but does allow anyone with knowledge to take over the build container as root.
BottomLine: Good discussion on the implications of this vulnerability

Description: Today's article is a face off between Kubernetes and Serverless. We start as we often do with a brief intro, and this one dives into what is the best approach for DevOps. We dive in with a decent section on "what is serverless", which talks about what it is, the benefits, and also providers you can use for it. Next up we go thorough a "what is Kubernetes" section, where it speedruns an overview and touches on providers that do this service too. Next up is a head to head comparison, where they go through 5 key areas and explain how each approach tackles them. They wrap with some basic recommendations, and even talk about possibly running both - they hybrid approach. Ultimately, the decision that fits your enviornment is what works best for your company.
BottomLine: Good walkthrough of Serverless vs. Kubernetes for hosting apps
