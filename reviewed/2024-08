Description: Seems it's important to understand Cert management for Kubernetes. The motivation they use isn't too strong, just talking about lapsed renewal instead of talking about why you want TLS. We get a laundry list of what certificates are in general, and then what Kubernetes does with them. We then move to the meat of this article -- checking cert validity and expiration. They show CLI commands to display various bits to display the expiry from either openssl or kubeadm. They wisely advise backing the certs up, and then walk through the commands to renew the certs. They also advise to restart the pods and also to do some clean up. Overall a good base, but would have been better with a bit more flow and organisation.
BottomLine: Decent piece on the renewal of TLS certs in Kubernetes

Description: This article goes through setting up a logging service in Kubernetes. After the motivation, we start with a diagram -- I hope that's a good sign. We also start with great advice - ensure proper logging of your apps. They then talk a bit about the Java logging piece they use and ints config. They include a sample XML file for their logger config. We now move on to some microservices that are logging in JSON format. The LGTM stack uses Minio for storage, which is an S3 like on-prem object store. They give the YAML to get this running. We now move onto managing the stored log files with Loki. There are a few options, and they went with a simple scalable install for Loki. This creates three services - writer, reader and backend. Loki uses labels to write and then read the logs, which it uses for indexing and faster searches. We then get a Helm chart to do the Loki install and setup. Once this is done, we turn to feeding the data into the logging system. In the past we might have used Grafana agent, but this has now been replaced with Alloy which our author opts for. Again we deploy Alloy from a Helm chart. Last but not least, we want to see our logs, so we do the visualizaion through Grafana and deploy this with another Helm chart. It's a good walkthrough.
BottomLine: Walk through setting up logging for Kubernetes

Description: So this article will be looking into Kubernetes basics from a security perspective. We start with the usual "what is Kubernetes", and then we move onto the core concepts. (There is a weird unhelpful diagram here). They go through namespaces, pods, nodes, services, and deployments. Each gets a solid paragraph explaining what it is. Now we dive into the architecture, and cover the control plane and node concepts, with sub-concepts covered for each higher level area. We finally get to security, and here we cover network policies, pod security policies, secrets management, and audits. Each has a paragraph on it. So, it's a decent high level overview for someone who has never seen K8s before.

Description: This article tackles the question of why Kubernetes doesn't manage users. First, they explain how authentication and authorization happen in Kubernetes - where TLS is used with Certs to figure out what identity should be used and if it is valid, and then RBAC to figure out what an identity should have access to. They point out that this is challenging for larger deployments, so K8s has ability to offload these parts to third party AA providers. They then go through some of the reasons orgs may want to do their own auth, which includes a diverse set of use cases and different security considerations. Next up, we look at ways to hook external connectors for auth up, and these include OIDC, LDAP and Webhooks with custom auth plugins. They then go through each option in turn, with a large secton on how they work, how to config, test, and then configure RBAC to work with them. They tie this up with a motivator on using RBAC properly and suggestions on which 3rd pary auth to use when. Oveall a solid piece.

Description: This is supposed to be an article about AKS, but the formatting is bad. On Firefox, the first paragraph is just one long line, which is not great. I'm not usually that worried about this stuff, but makes reading challenging. This is focused on Azure, but it's pretty thin. We get good headings, including network security, identity and access management, container security, secrets management and finally monitoring and logging. Under each heading, we get 2 or usually 3 bullet points on what to do. They then have a section on Best practices which is another 5 bullet points, and finishes with 3 additional consideration points. My honest take is that someone had an idea but not time to write a full article, so did the minimum. The points aren't bad, but everything is super terse and feels like a person new to Azure/AKS would be intimidated by this approach.

Description: This article aims to create optimal container images, which help with both performance and security. We jump right into an issue - that of reaching the DockerHub limit. They suggest alternatives like an alternate Registry, or if your infra is in the cloud, you can use the one for your cloud provider - eg ECR for AWS. Next up is using build contexts, and only copying the directories you need for deployment to the final image. Along these lines, they have suggestions for multi-arch builds and image caching, before explaing the usage of golden image creation. Each of these get about a paragraph explaining what they are and why you may want to use them. Now they start on optimizing, and we start with multi-stage builds - creating one image for the build part, and then just taking what is needed for the run to copy over. They also talk about minimizing layers and starting with lightweight images, again to reduce size and attack surface. We now switch to securing our container, which includes thinking about how environment variables are used. They go through doing a vulnerability scan, and also not using the root user if possible. They also recommend avoiding image:latest, which refers not to a specific version, but just the last one currently tagged.
BottomLine: Excellent coverage of optimizing and securing images for Docker and Kubernetes

Description: This article is based on an interview of one of the Cilium leads, and talks about where Cilium is going in the future. First, we get a background of the current landscape, and how eBPF has helped and been integrated into Kubernetes with Tetragon. The article shifts a bit to highlight AI and what the demands are there. The arguement made is that AI is better automation, allowing you to mitigate threats and issues in a more proactive way. The role they see for Cilium in this is one of universal data plane, but they don't say what this looks like. There is a bit of handwaving about software-defined networking, so perhaps at that level? (Side note - Cilium is powered by eBPF, and the article doesn't clarify that). They do mention that it's a question of whether eBPF can handle both layer 4 and layer 7 traffic that is needed. After this warm up, there are acutally quotes from the interviews with Youtube snips. In this part, they talk about what cloud native security might look like, issues with service mesh, how NSX fits into the picture, and ends with a little bit on the Cisco acquisition of Isovalent.

Description: This article looks into multi-cluster Kubernetes. We dive in quickly and are told that any config where we have more than one cluser fits - multiple on the same hosts, different hosts in the same DC, or multiple clouds. We then do a tour of a normal cluster and the control/data/worker planes, along with a diagram. Apparently the extra part in the multi-cluster is a global load balancer outside of the traditional K8s infra with another diagram. But they go on to explain, this is just one of a number of multi-clust configs. They break down both segmented vs repication and K8s centric vs network centric, with a couple paragraphs fleshing things out. They then have a longer section covering the benefits, with bits dedicated to flexibility, availability, scalability and resource utilization, workload isolation and security and compliance, with a few paragraphs for each. They also detail the drawbacks, including complexity, config, security, deployment and cost. Overall, a good treatment of the topic.

Description: This is a blog on a skeptics first experience with Kubernetes. We start with a section on the author and his approach, and that this is his experience and opinion. He takes a practical approach, and starts from first principles, doing a brief description of what K8s is in the abstract before moving on to define the various resources that are used in K8s. He even illustrates with a diagram. He has a great explaination of controllers - they are "control loops" that use sensors to perform actions on workloads. He has a few examples, like a sensor looking for latency, and if it grows beyond a certain point spinning up more pods. He then talks about how a service works, and the various mechanics to have it run seemlessly. He pegs it as a network resource, where you get a stable endpoint (IP/port) which is then mapped to pods which support the underlying app. They even go through a traffic flow diagram. Next we move on to what he calls workload management - they show an imperitive invocation, and then explain a replica set and how this is a declarative invocation. The last K8s thing he tackles is storage, explaining ephemeral storage along with durable storage through Persistent volumes. He then documents some open questions and things he hasn't explored, which is neat. He also includes a small rant against something he sees as an issue in various config files. Overall, a great read and recommended.

Description: This article is part of a series, and this installment focuses on authorization, or what a verified user can do. We start with a diagram, which is always a good sign. They note upfront that there are flexible authorization modules, which allow multiple ways to do this auth. These can be chained together, and modules can do an explicit approve or deny, or alternatively respond "no opinion", which drops through to the next member of the chain. If all chain members respond "no opinion", the request is implicitly denied. They note that since auth is split up, there is no way to get all permissions a user has easily, and all of the configs have to be audited one by one. They note there is a special group, system:masters, which is like root and doesn't check auth modules, but they also note ordinary users should never be placed in this group for that reason. They talk about some special modes, including Node Authorizer, which is intended to restrict priv escalation. Normally kubelet has access to all secrets, to be able to provide them to requesting pods, but a compromise can allow an attacker access to the kubelet; the idea here is to restrict this to kubelets running on nodes. They also mention AlwaysAllow and AlwaysDeny, along with ABAC, an attribute-based control run from static JSON files on nodes, which is rarely used because of the lack of flexibility. Next is RBAC, which they have a diagram for and go into decent detail about. We end this section with a dive into Webhook, which allows a call to an external provider that returns a response. We then talk about other components, like Kubelet and the Scheduler and Controller manager and how they are controlled. While this is a shorter piece, it's clear and well delivered, and a recommend.

It starts with a diagram, which I like, and also a heads up -- that some things can be done better using OCI, and include a reference. We dive in by starting at the beginning, and installing Helm. We then use the CLI to create a chart, and tweak the config files (and they include a link to a repo to help with this). They do an error check, and then check out a file to create docs. We're taken through a couple YAML configs with explainations. We now turn to Git, and we issue a CLI command to create a branch, and then we need to complete the Helm bits -- they give two options, one copying a file and the other using Helm to "package" the chart and generate the file. Now we need to deploy the Chart to get something to happen. To do this, we commit/push our Helm Chart and then have to do a bit of setup on the GitHub side (with a video walkthrough). Once set up, they bump the version number, push it and observe that the workflow runs. They then run through using or installing/templating your chart, and finally how to publish your Helm chart on artifacthub.io. Pretty good walkthrough.

Description: In an entirely new development, Kubernetes is good and bad security is caused by misconfigs. We waste no time and dive right into things with Pod Security Standards - there are three enforcement levels. First up is privleged, which allows the most actions and is the least restrictive. Restricted is the least permissive, and can sometimes cause issues with apps running in it. It's the goal, but not always where you can run every app. The middle ground is baseline, which is more permissive but does try to mitigate priv escalations. We are then introduced to the Pod security admission controller, which is how Kubernetes enforces security. We pivot back to PSS to talk about levels -- namely the Cluster and Namespace levels, which impacts how and where they are available and what they do. Cluster level allows you to enforce security configs cluster wide, while also allowing you to include exceptions. The drawback is that this won't be avialable on most managed K8s providers. On the pod level, we go through an actual config by setting up a namespace and applying the PSS with YAML and CLI bits. They do note a few namespaces - default, kube-public, kube-system - are at the privileged level by default. Overall a decent walkthrough.
BottomLine: Intro and short walkthrough of Pod Security Standards for Kubernetes

Next up is Commands, so they start with a run command to start a pod and a get pods to check that it's running. We look at a variation of the previous commands to give a bit more info, and then a describe pods to give us lots of details. They include a snip of the output so we know what the output should look like. We are then taken through the delete command to clean up a pod no longer needed, with a bit of explaination. We then are shown how to use YAML to create a pod. They throw in some links for further exploration.

We dive right in with Docker Swarm, and we get an intro, some key features, and a few one-line use cases. For Swarm, the big selling point is tight integration with Docker, making it easy to use. Next up is Kubernetes, which they do mention is the industry standard, and it gets the same key features and one liner use cases. They position K8s for large complex workloads. Next up is Apache Mesos, whose main draw is abstraction of all compute - CPU, memory, storage - enabling fault-tolerant systems. It echos the key features and use cases. Last up is CoreOS Fleet, a way to manage a cluster that is already running a CoreOS on the members, and it again gets the key features and use cases roundup. They don't come out with a winner, but rather say it depends on your team and needs, which is fair. It's a good intro to alternatives, which are always good to consider.

Description: Recently there was a CrowdStrike issue which caused issues with millions of computers - our article ponders if there was a way to prevent that. We start with bullet points and then a recap of the outage, where a faulty sensor file caused a crash. They claim that the issues was due to "dated architecture", and that managing kernel drivers can be difficult, as they have ultimate access. They go on to question the viability of having such elevated access granted to things like CrowdStrike's app. They also express doubt about SaaS solutions. They advance eBPF as a way to manage this risk, as it is sandboxed in its kernel access. Another tact would be something like a phased rollout. They go on to argue that concentration is bad, and that since it was widely deployed, this shows the system was fragile. They argue that diversity is helpful. We now circle back to eBPF, with a highlight to the benefits without really touching on how eBPF solves this issue. They then handwave a bit at stopping attacks in real time with eBPF. Okay, now for my take -- wow. I feel this piece says to use eBPF to "solve" the problem, but it never says HOW it solves this problem. Don't get me wrong -- I think eBPF can be a solid tool in the security toolbox. But CrowdStrike is a threat intel and attack mitigation tool, which uses signatures and instruments to locate threats. eBPF can do SOME of that, but not all, and not like CrowdStrike -- they are mostly complimentary tools. If the piece said "if you had eBPF in there and configured right, you could have stopped this update" .. okay, that may be valuable. But that doesn't seem to be the arguement here. So, it's an interesting read but be skeptical.
BottomLine: Security piece that advocates using eBPF in light of CrowdStrike issue but does so disjointedly

Then we get into what each tool is in more detail, starting with Loki and then going on to Elasticsearch. It explains how each of them work, and a bit of the benefits and challenges. We also get a chart with the comparison features. Now we go through major features and how each tool deals with them. They go through storage, indexing, query language, log ingestion and user interface. Each section gets at least a paragraph, with some getting much more, and the UIs getting screenshots. Oddly, as they are winding down they pitch SigNoz as an alternative, which is by the hosters of th page.

Description: This is a followup to the author's Kubernetes 101 article, and this one focuses on containerization in K8s, so let's dive in. We start with the point that K8s is a container orchestration system, so understanding containers is a key part. We revisit the pre-container situation, explaining the way interactions and dependencies make deployments challenging on a bare OS (VM or bare metal). They talk about the isolation a container has, and then go through the pros and cons of containers. We get a diagram, to complement a chat about architecture. They go through container runtime, the bits that actual run a container, and container image, the bits that run the target app, and explain that togther they form the application container. Another diagram and we're talking about how K8s does it's part with containers. We start with the control plane pieces, and go through the kube-apiserver, etcd, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager and cloud-controller-manager. Each component gets at least a paragraph, with a bit more attention paid to the scheduler as they node that is what assigns pods to nodes. Next we look at the node side, and that includes kubelet, kube-proxy, and the container runtime, and they all get the same paragraph treatment. Last, they go through some addon bits, including DNS, Web UI, container resource monitoring and cluster-level logging. It's short but covers the basics, and is a decent intro.

They mention that it provides visibility into the various layers, and if it detects a vulnerability it surfaces remediation actions to help mitigate the issue. We are told that it searches for updates to both the base image and any layers, so you can see where the issue is in the chain. They talk a bit about integration into the Docker ecosystem, as well as using SBOMs and CVEs to do analysis without having to do a full re-scan of the images every time. We're then treated to a laundry list of problems solved, te most interesting to me is what they call "event driven vuln updates", which notice new CVEs and leverage SBOMs to give you up to date recommendations. They then show how to enable it on Docker Hub, and then go through the CLI with a lot of examples. My take is that it should be something we check out, but this is probably better done in the Integration step then at the developer level except for small projects.

For their approach, we're going to use Docker, but the mention being able to use a myriad of Virtual Machine programs (like VMware, QEMU and VirtualBox to name a few). Docker runs on the three major desktop OSes and they include links for the downloads. Next of course is installing Minikube, for each OS and even for a few different approaches. Once we're here, they ask to verify by checking version number on the CLI. Next up, we issue the command to start minikube, which fires up our local cluster. They even have a troubleshooting step in case it doesn't start cleanly. Once that is done, we want to make sure we can interact with the control plane, so check kubectl's version. Next, they fire up the we dashboard with a CLI command. They then show us how to get a list of what the cluster is running. Finally, they show us how to clean up and delete all the resources we created with a CLI command. A decent basic runthrough.

First we tackle legacy API gateways, and they give examples of Mulesoft and Apigee for this type. They point out that they lack dynamic features, are usually centralized so don't leverage K8s distributed nature and need more effort to be HA. They have a list of 4 main cons to these types, along with a few sentences fleshing them out. Next up are the agnostic gateways, with examples given of Kong and Gloo. These are more modern, but not built specifically for K8s, and may need more configuration and may not use K8s features like load balancing or service discovery. This time we get a list of 5 cons, each with a couple sentences of illustration. Finally, we get to Kubernetes native API gateways, which fully take advantage of K8s features like auto discovery and intelligent routing.

Description: Managing Kubernetes with all of its YAML files can be a pain, so this article will look at the tool Pepr to assist with that. First it talks a bit about the pieces around Pepr which seemed geared to Javascript programmers, which is fair enough. We get really started with the install and setup, which they refer to an external video. In our article, they compare Pepr to Kyverno and Operator frameworks. Next we take a peek into the architecture, and start with a huge diagram. They do point out the JS-like TypeScript is supposed to be plain english, and do illustrate that with a couple of examples. Next we talk about abstractions, and how there are three strong ones - modoule, capability and action, and we get another diagram to boot. They go through the dev loop, which I think is how all the actions are handled; we lost a bit of the plain english here. To follow that up, they mention that WebAssembly is also supported along with TS, and that it makes it more versatile and accessible. I think the access comes from languages that can compile to or output WebAssembly. Next we hop over to Logging and monitoring, and they talk about it for a few paras. We then are taken through Deployment, which shows us how it can be used in Prod, with another diagram. There are some more bits, including security and scaling that they talk about. It's an interesting tool, but there is some handwaving here and there and not a strong case made for why to jump to it, but it might be worth kicking the tires on.
BottomLine: New config-management tool Pepr for Kubernetes YAML

Description: An honest assessment of whether Kubernetes is a good fit for your paticular project, from a K8s architect. The author goes through 8 highlighted areas, with at least a couple of sub points each. The areas include app complexity, scalability, team expertise, resource management, ops overhead, cost considerations and deployment frequency to name a few. The author then talks about a handful of specific areas, explaining the benefits or challenges with each. In the end, it depends on a myriad of factors, but the author does a good job of focusing on the high value ones and giving some solid advice.
BottomLine: Good piece which helps to decide if using Kubernetes is the right call

Description: This is a retrospective on RedHat's annual state of Kubernetes security for 2024, with various highlights pointed out. We dive in and start with misconfiguration, and while concern for this is decreasing, it's still an important concern as a misconfig can lead to a serious issue. Possible vulns ticks up as a concern, as more issues in the supply chain surface. Incidents have been dropping, but they are still over 2021 era levels. It seems DevSecOps is on the uptick, and means that orgs are taking security a bit more seriously. They include a handy chart with answers segmented over the last 4 years, highlighting things that are trending downward. The second part of this article is explaining how Armo addresses these issues, and it feels like an elaborate ad. I'm happy they talk to various points and highlight how their platform helps, but their conclusion that they cover "100% of the top risk concerns" doesn't ensure customers use the product correctly and mitigate those risks. I think it's fine to say your product mitigates or solves risks, but there is a lot of verbiage here at a high level. My overall take is the first part is helpful, and the pitch could have been a paragraph or two instead of being almost as long as the highlights.
BottomLine: First half is a strong summary of RedHat state of Kubernetes 2024 but second half is an odd ad

Description: Security is a challenge with Kubernetes, and many orgs are forced to hold back because they can't solve security problems. Security checks to resolve issues shouldn't be an afterthought, so the author advocates for DevSecOps. This is security during the build, deploy and run phases; but there are still other bits to be considered. We start with a bit of info on pods, but they mention that defaults can be lax and apparently this can be used to "contaminate" other pods. We then talk about runtime issues, but then dip into some survey for reasons, but then come back to restricting traffic through network policies. Then we go through a tour of K8s security best practices. My take is ... whelp. It feels like a bad AI product; it talks a bunch about DevSecOps, but everything feels magic. It's a lot of fluff and basic stuff, and not really a good tackling of anything head-on.
BottomLine: Pass on this Kubernetes security piece that is not head on

Description: Security is important in Kubernetes - and protecting service account tokens is an important component in this, which this article looks at. Account tokens is how apps communicate to the K8s API, but they argue that being too liberal with access can have bad consequences. To allow access to the token, K8s by default provides it with a mount into each pod. The arugement that they make is that rather than have a default permissive token, that each app should have a crafted token that only allows the permissions that are required. To control this, they recommend turning off the automatic mounting of the token store. They talk a bit about using RBAC to have the right permissions, along with audits and monitoring to track what is being done. Overall a decent piece.
BottomLine: Discussion and recommendations for security on Kubernetes service account tokens

Description: Kubernetes storage is complicated, but it is the defacto tool so this article will try to simplify the issues. We start with some of the benefits of K8s storage and where things have to be done right. They have a motivator for why you should use best practices for storage, and then we dive in. They cover dnyamic volumes, scaling, fast performance, security, backup/disaster recovery, and data storage and management. They do a decent dive on each, with a multi-paragraph treatment or more. Finally they have a pitch to use Portworx to handle your stoarge. Overall a decent piece.
BottomLine: Article that talks about many aspects of Kubernetes storage

DateReviewed: 2024-08-28
Description: This article is a review of the four CVEs found this year that affect Kubernetes deployments, dubbed the "Leaky Vessels". They talk about the main vector, which seems to be runc, and the fallout, which is allowing CLI commands that could enable breakouts. They approach this with a short intro to the CVE, then a technical breakdown, a vuln assessment, an impact and finally a mitigation section. For most of the issues, they are from an older version of buildkit and are centered around issues from Docker, although they do pose vulnerabilities for Kubernetes. The article also explains ways to help guard against some of the attacks -- for instance, by not letting a container root write to the host filesystem. Overall a good bit of insight into these attacks.
BottomLine: Good walkthrough on the vulnerabilities and mitigations for the Leaky Vessel group of container aimed CVEs

DateReviewed: 2024-08-29
Description: This blog will use Workload identity with federated credentials to implement a zero trust approach. We start with a diagram, which is always a good sign. We start with Terraform to provision the environment, and we run through a config file and then init and create the plan, before applying and actually building the environment. They walk us through the built system in the Azure console, to show what has been created. We then go through a piece to set up the oidc (federation) provider, with a config and some outputs along with a CLI command. Next up, they use Helm to deploy an external secrets operator to enable your workload identity provider with two Helm CLI commands, and then another couple commands to create a namespace for the Identity provider and a template deployment to enable it. Another diagram or two, but they do go through the various parts in text to help us understand what is going on. Once that is done, they show us the YAML we need to use the external provider, and finally the kubectl CLI command to get it working. Another YAML file to inject secrets, and explaination of what is going on, an (optional) NS creation and finally applying it through kubectl CLI. They show us how to verify the provider is running and how to test for a secret to ensure it works.
BottomLine: Decent walkthrough of using federated identity on an Azure Kubernetes cluster

DateReviewed: 2024-08-30
Description: This is a discussion of how OpenSSF scorecard is run -- it itself is a way to assess the security of a workload running in a container. The focus of this article is the decisions made when building and running the project. We start with a bit of a rhetorical question - how do we get a cron-like behavior out of Kubernetes? They went with Kubernetes Jobs to achieve this functionality. Now they break down how this works, starting with a scheduler to run the jobs, run as a microservice. It's job is to start the K8s Jobs and then collect the results. They dive into the actual GO code, but what they are looking for is repos that have been updated and need testing. They deep dive into how the pool works and how many threads it can use. Once enoughh time passes, they have to update the scorecard for a repo, and schedule the check in K8s Jobs. It then waits for the completion for the results. They then travel through the various perms needed to run the jobs and for the K8s Jobs to have access to run those resources, as YAML. A great walk through!
BottomLine: Very solid walk through on using Kubernetes Jobs to run parts of the OpenSSF scorecard
