Description: Our article here is going to touch on how containers sometimes fail to contain - and they start with an analogy to Jurrasic Park, and how the dinos were not contained. We dive in starting with container basics, going though how it's a single bundle running on an OS, which is mostly isolated. They point out that at a low level, a container is just a child on the host system. We get a neat diagram illustrating containers/namespaces and the Linux features that help out. The container runtime are the gates, allowing containers to start, do things, and stop. But they say, gates sometimes fail. We get another diagram, with arrows and a label of container escapes, so let's see what we're going to delve into. They talke about permission issues with mounts, allowing unintended file access; or a buffer overflow, allowing access to shared memory. Misconfigs can even allow CLI commands on the host from the container, and lastly, priv escalation that results in root access, allowing the attacker carte blanche. Next up they are going to do a demo with eBPF. They say that clever code can get around the verifier and JIT compiler, allowing execution of unsafe bytecode. They go into a bit of detail on how the verifier works, ensuring there are no unreachable instructions and simulating each control branch. They point to a few actual instances of CVEs involving the verifier, and are going to focus on a recent one. The walkthrough is quite simple - we build a user container, include the nasty code in the image, then run the binary and are root when done. Pretty cool. They go into mitigations with supply chains and SBOMs, but basically you have to be vigilant. Excellent article.
BottomLine: Awesome article showing a straightforward container escape in Kubernetes

Description: This article is a followup on a previous case where they did some performance tuning. They take that as a baseline and attempt to get even more throughput here. We start by looking at metrics like throughput, errors, latency and scalability. They assign goals, like doubling the baseline throughput, as where they want to go. They mention that as Kubernetes scales the cluster, that current strategy doesn't take full advantage, as already connected clients stay with the same pods, impeding proper load balancing. They show this in a graph. They say using Istio solves this, as it has proxies to help loadshare better, and so they move to this. They show the YAML needed, and an after graph, showing a much more even usage among the clients. They talk a bit about errors and latency, and it's important to note these are config only changes -- none of this needs any code change so far. Next they show how by doing tiny tweaks you can get some exta performance out of the system. They go through a few more esoteric tweaks, before circling back and noting they had achived all of the goals they had put out. Interesing but highly technical piece.
BottomLine: Low level performance tweaks to get more out of your Kubernets cluster

Description: This article aims to introduce Kubernetes networking in a simple way. We start with a diagram, so that is good. We dive in basically right away, covering basics, like each pod getting an IP and not needing to link or map things internally for K8s. They also explain that each pod can talk to any other pod without NAT, and programs on a node can talk to all pods on that node by default. Next we cover four concerns - now containers in a pod talk, how cluster networking allows comms between pods; how services allow apps to be reached from outside the cluster, and that services can be used inside the cluster. To finish up, we get some YAML files and CLI commands to demonstrate. Overall, it's decent but seems not well formed and flowing, so I'd say an okay toe dip.
BottomLine: Ok intro to Kubernetes networking and related concepts

Description: This article talks about updates to the CNCF exam. First, they start by highlighting the growth of the Kubernetes community and CNCF in the past few years, including the number of people certified. They then explain that as things evolve and change, so must the skills that people have and also the exams. The exam was updated on October 15th, and while things like cluster stup and hardening will remain, some things will be phased out while others will be added, and some of the weights may change. My take -- I wish they'd talked a bit more about the broad areas of change, like what new topics would be included and what will be phased out.
BottomLine: News about changes to the CNCF certification exam but no details

Description: We start with Kubernets being great, but it only able to manage layer 3 and 4 traffic - implying we're missing some observability. To our rescue comes Cilium, which they point out can do Layer 7 traffic control and all kinds of other bells and whistles including observability. They also point out that while K8s uses IP based traffic models, Cilium uses pod labels to ensure even if IPs change due to K8s dynamic nature, policies are applied correctly. We then do a bit of CLI and YAML exploring, to get some hands on. Further, they point out we can filter not just on destination, but on things like the URL path and request method, giving much finer grained control. We do some more hands on, and then talk a bit about high-performance considerations. Overall a good article.
BottomLine: Solid article on using Cilium to enforce network policies in Kubernetes

Description: Our article will walk us through things like services and load balancing with a 2-tier application. They give us a small setup and then right into things - YAML to deploy the backend pods. We do some CLI to spin them up and check they are running. We now go through the process of setting up a service, so the frontend pods can talk to the backend, and we start with a YAML file. We then do some CLI magic, finally confirming the service is up on an IP:port combo. To simplify things, we look at using coreDNS to map the IP, so our frontend doesn't need to know the IP directly. We walk through setting up and using DNS, and verify our service resolves. Now we do a bit of deep diving, going through the weeds of how services work behind the scenes. It also explains the role kube-proxy plays in getting the traffic to the right spot. It explains how K8s leverages iptables to do the re-routing of packets to the right pod(IP) for a service. They have a few good diagrams here, which are great. They then follow a packet through, so you get a sense of how the flow actually works. After all of this, we finally need to deploy the frontend pods, and we start with the YAML for that. This time we deploy three replicas, in contrast to the one we did for the backend. We follow the CLI commands to spin them up and verify they are running. We then expose them, so traffic from outside the cluster can reach the pods. They also explain how Load Balancing works. There are some other things I won't cover, but each part has diagrams and really good explainations -- this is one of the best explainers on this stuff that I've come across.
BottomLine: Excellent explainer of Kubernetes services and how they work

Description: Kubernetes is ever evolving, and as such players have to understand the impacts of things like Policy as Code have, and this article will attempt to do that. There are two main was to achieve this - one is seccomp profiles, and the other is network policies. They relate PaC to things like IaC for infrastructure. They have similar goals as IaC, which is to reduce human error, ensuring consistency and accelerating development velocity. They explain what seccomp is, how it works and gives a sample of the config bits. They then cover some best practices. We move on to network policies, where they explain the why and how, and explain the approach. They tie in some guardrails to run this and finally explain how to run this togther. A bit in the weeds in spots, but decent overall.
BottomLine: Decent article on how to do policy as code in Kubernetes

Description: Okay, so this is a bit weird. There is no motivation or intro to this piece, and we start with a diagram, which I'm usually happy about. But our first text is a "design checklist" done in point form, and that is how this whole piece is constructed. The tips are good, and since this is all AKS the insights can be helpful. Next up are recommendations, and they also seem solid, and have explainations where appropriate. Moving on we get to security, with some guidelines and recommendations. But other than this general approach info, the piece doesn't go anywhere else. While I'd say AKS users might get something out of it, it's a bit hard to read for flow reasons.
BottomLine: Interesting recommendations for AKS Kubernetes but laid out in a difficult flow

Description: This piece explores ways to utilize Cilium and Istio to improve network security. We start with a video link that inspired the piece. The way this is laid out is to introduce a term, explain it, and include a diagram which shows the place in the system. We start with CNI, then cover service mesh, and then a short para about how they are related. They take similar approaches with Istio and Cilium, explaining what they are, how they work, and what is going on under the hood. Overall very good.

Description: This article talks about F5's BIG IP product in relation to Kubernetes. It feels like an ad more than a tech document, as we talk a lot about AI but not so much about how this helps in Kubernetes. Lots of buzzwords and name dropping, but not a lot of explaination of what it does or how it does it. How does it help AI? It implies it makes it faster, but I'm not sure how? It also "protects" the AI landscape, but again, how? We end with a bunch of quotes, none of which helps on what it does.

Description: We start with container being good, but there are security issues. We start with an overview of containers, so assume almost no knowledge here. We then cover the issue from security issues - breaches, downtime and compliance issues. Next we move to various actual issues, where they take us through the risk, and example and finally a solution. They cover image issues, breakouts, configuration problems, and API config issues. They then tackle each of these with mitigations and hardening. They then talk about things like RBAC and various policies that help enforce limits and security. Overall a decent approach.
BottomLine: Good overall approach to most aspects of Kubernetes security

Description: This article tries to explain how confidential computing works regarding secrets. So, I'll say there is a diagram and a bunch of flow charts, which is awesome for an article usually. It is also technical, which I also usually think is good -- but not in this case. While it gets into the weeds of data flow and explains that fairly well, it doesn't really explain the what and the why in a good way. Like I can understand how things flow, but I don't understand why this pod/node combo should get a key and the other one shouldn't. What problem does this guard against, and how does it achieve that? It's a bit fuzzy.
BottomLine: Okay job of describing the mechanism of confidential computing but not the why

Description: Our article tries to compare native VM capabilities compared with Kubernetes resources. They do mention that since K8s is more ephemeral, different approaches are needed for things like DR. They focus on something called Changed Block Tracking (CBT), which they mention allows efficient incremental backup. While popular on VMs and other systems, they were missing on K8s until now. To help build this, K8s introducted StatefulSets and then the Container Storage Ingerface (CSI), which allowed containers to use true persistent storage. To support these changes, VolumeSnapShot was rolled out in 2020, which then allows CBT to be an option. They have some more details an a small diagram to close things up. My take is while this gets into the weeds, they do a lot of upfront work to explain things and it's a good piece.
BottomLine: Very solid into to CBT on Kubernetes and how it enables incremental storage backups

Description: This is actually a decent walkthrough on how to containerize a Node app. The assumption is you know a bit of Node, but you've never seen Docker or Kubernetes. He drops the JS dependencies and the bit of code to create a basic app, and we're off to the races. He takes us through building a Docker image with a Dockerfile, and then how to install minikube on MacOS. We then start minikube and load in the image we just created, before creating the deployment YAML and spinning up the deployment. They even explain the YAML line by line. To make it useful, they also go through creating a Service with the YAML and deployment to allow non-cluster computers to talk to it. Finally, they walk us through minikube tunnel, which allows us to connect to the service from our computer. A very good walkthorugh!
BottomLine: Great walkthrough of taking a Node app and turning it into an image and deploying it to Kubernetes

Description: Our article points out that while Kubernetes built its foundation on stateless application, today you can run a DB on Kubernetes. Now, our author claims stateless apps do not keep data between requests, whereas stateful persists info between them. To help achieve this, any database pod needs a persistent volume or PV in K8s parlayance. They point out for scaling, we can use leader/follower arch where the primary database handles all writes and reads are sent to replicas. They talk about StatefulSets, where data is retained even if a pod is restarted, and some identifies are stable. Now they venture into a tutorial to set up a Database on K8s. They use MySQL, and go through all the steps and YAML needed to create the infra and db itself, and how to snag the logs. They also touch on doing backups and creating alerts. Overall a good piece.
BottomLine: Background and tutorial on setting up a Database in Kubernetes

Description: This article will go through setting up a Cloudflare tunnel to point to a local Kubernetes cluster, ideal for devel or home uses. We start with a diagram, always a good spot to start. They explain why it's good to have your own domain, and then dive into what a Cloudflare tunnel is. The idea is your local box connects outbound to Cloudflare, allowing a connection to be made from CF back into your local app. They argue while you can connect the tunnel to a specific service, they prefer to hook it up to Ingress, so you can then adjust it as your local situation changes. We now go through the pre-reqs and outline how this will be done - the author is using KinD and a domain. He then goes through creating the cluster and installing Ingress, then creating the namespaces for external-dns and cloudflared, the bit that connects outbound. He then shows how to create a CF token and save it in the config through secrets. There is some setup on  the CF side theat he goes through, and then sets up TLS. Finally we create the Ingress to connect to a blog app as a demo. They test and show we can connect to the blog. Interesting little article.

Description: While Kubernetes is a good way to approach AI workloads, this article argues that we need to pay attention to things like cost and availability of GPUs when running these apps. We start with a diagram and a bit of explaination, talking about model training and inferencing and how each workload works. They tease out a way to target a specific GPU class and type, and bind to it with either a high or medium priority, depending on the nature of the workload. They do mention there is more to it, but they are trying to cover broad strokes here. They then show how to mark the nodes and pods in YAML to get the desired effect. We are then shown how to manage GPU resources, including an open source script that surfaces GPU utilization. Overall, an interesting discussion.

Description: This article talks about secrets in Kubernetes, and starts off by talking about what types of things we might consider a secret. Mainly used for things that allow access, like passwords, API keys and other credentials. We often don't want them stored or logged, and want them protected. They talk about other considerations, like rotation and opacity. They do suggest short-lived tokens where possible, but this isn't always feasible. Our author explains that K8s secrets were solving having hardcoded values in an image, or even checked into the source code control system. They do mention other systems, and touch on the challenge is how to get the secret into the pod that needs it securely and easily. They also point out that some vendor solutions aren't portable, and make sharing secrets harder in development or alternate deployments, as opposed to K8s secrets. I like this discussion, even if this article is just a starting point.

Description: This piece is an interview with an industry person about Kubernetes security. Unlike most K8s sec pieces, this article says that things have gotten better security wise, but focus here is on managed K8s at a provider. But self-managed are still problematic it seems. One thing they mention is keeping up to date, but the other thing they talk about are isolation technologies. They do touch on all of the usual K8s security bits, but talk a bit about treating containers like a VM, which fully insulates each pod from every other. It's a neat approach, but they don't explain the implications too much.

As a toe dip, they don't really dive into anything; it's more calling out a tech and then talking a little bit about what it is. They cover serverless computing, Kubernetes and containers, AI and ML, DevOps for edge compting and finally enhanced security practices. I'd like to have seen them dig a bit deeper, maybe an intro and then a para or two on where things are going and interesting topics in the area, but this is a survey and they went light.

Description: This article will dive into Sidecar containers. We start with a defintion, which is that we use sidecars to do support work, like logging, freeing the main container to only worry about running the main app. They also point out sidecars can be used in networking approaches like meshes. Next up we get practical, and they show us a YAML config for a sidecar, and then they break down the config line by line. We then move onto how Sidecars interact with Pod lifecycles, including explaining that generally sidecars are started first and left running after the main app, in case their duties require that. They also contrast jobs with Sidecars and explain the roles of Containers in a pod. They venture into things like resource limits and constraints.

Description: This article talks about using Talos Linux as your Kubernetes OS of choice. We start by talking a bit about Talos, which is a Kubernetes focuse OS. It tries to be more secure, by excluding things like SSH; it reduces included packages and is "API driven" in management. At it's core, it is immutable, a good fit for K8s philosophy of deploying new copies rather than changing on the fly. We get a diagram, and they talk a bit about the API, about how Kubelet is integrated into the OS and how the Networking stack is closely aligned with K8s. They then talk a bit about K8s on VMs vs K8s on bare metal, and the advantages and disadvantages of that. They talk about some other managed K8s, like GKE, Rancher and Openshift and how Talos has advantages. They then go through some benefits and challeges, and even a use case for Talos. A decent high level tour!
BottomLine: Decent high-level tour of Talos, a bare metal OS for Kubernetes

They start by trying to explain real-life roles and how they relate to what people do, before transitioning to talking about K8s and how roles are used in it. Honestly I thought this was going to be a bad article, but after a not great intro they have a pretty thorough hands on part.
