Description: This vid covers eBPF in about 2 minutes. First, we start going through the Linux kernel, and how it works at a basic level. Then, they pose the question - what if we want to change something in the kernel, and go through why we might want that. They say changing the kernel is hard, but we can use this cool thing called eBPF to do it. They then explain how eBPF programs are run inside a kernel VM. Basically, the VM system allows the compiler/toolchain to verify what is being done by the eBPF program, to ensure it only does things we want it to. High level but informative, this is a great intro to eBPF.
BottomLine: Great 2 minute intro to eBPF in the Linux kernel

Description: It seems that instead of using kernel modules, many companies are now using eBPF to do kernel related actions, and this article will look into that and how to break down a program that is intended to be run by eBPF. We start with an intro to eBPF, explaining how using eBPF is similar to a kernel module, and how it is run with a JIT compiler and in a sandbox environment. A verifier checks the program before running, constraining what can be done. To actually run a program, you need to have your code compiled by a compatible complier, and Clang is a popular option. The VM that is used contains registers, and they break down how they are divided up and what they do. They also go through the layout of Opcodes and a few examples so you can understand the layout. They then describe how you would actually get a BPF program to run, and how the kernel actually handles this. We then go through some of the setups and use-cases for eBPF. They note that a BPF program has access to and the potential to change privleged information, so care must be taken; they also note that there is a tight stack limit which must be kept in mind. They explain that eBPF is primarily event based, so the prinicipal way it interacts is to register hooks that get called with info passed to them. We have a diagram showing the call flow of various processes. They then spend a section explaining the verifier and how it works, breaking it down in detail, as it adds some quirks to how the flow works in an eBPF program. We finally arrive at reversing, and they pick a rootkit and go through an example. They find where it hooks, do a simple disassembly and step through, explaining all of the lines. They work through macros and function calls, breaking it all down. After the analysis, they explain that this program modifys and logs program execution. They then show the original source. What a great read.
BottomLine: Fantastic intro to eBPF and eBPF reversing

Description: This article will talk about service mesh, and we start with a diagram, so that is promising. Next up is the motivator, why do we need a service mesh. They point out that a monolith runs all code in a single binary and can simply invoke a function call, where microservices might need to call out to each other to achieve the same call, needing network communications to work. There are a number of concerns, including security, capacity, availability and authentication. A service mesh can help bring these under control. Next up we dive into what is service mesh, which seperates networking parts from biz logic parts. One container does the network, and another the biz logic, but all in one pod -- the sidecar pattern. We then dig into how service mesh does this - starting with predefined policies for security and routing. The mesh creates the sidecar when a pod is created, and handles all of the setup/redirects for the logic container. We then look at some  Mesh providers, namely Istio and Anthos. They do a bit of a deeper dive on Istio, explaining how the different pieces work. We conclude with a demo of service mesh on GKE, utilizing a small e-commerce app. We then pivot back and cover traffic management with Service mesh. Overall a decent piece, just oddly organized.
BottomLine: Interesting piece explaining Service Mesh on Kubernetes, with a simple demo walkthrough
