Description: Kubernetes is great, but security is blah because of .. hard coded passwords in Helm, is how we start. So we dive in, and they observe that usernames and passwords are encoded in base64, but they are easily decoded. They give a few ways to avoid this, including K8s secrets, external config, Helm values and even encrypted secrets. I think the big takeaway here is not to let your secrets be committed to a repository, and to use the most secure method to hide them you can.
BottomLine: Good discussion of password issues in the context of Kubernetes and Kubernetes tools -- Helm in this case

Description: Here we are going to look at the managed K8s service EKS from AWS - paticularly, the add-on part of it. We dive right in to understand add-ons, which are thing like networking solutions or monitoring tools that build on the base K8s functionality. This is a hands on, so you need an account and the right perms; we start with listing the add ons with the right CLI command. We then dive deeper with another command to grab details. They also show how to query using Helm and ConfigMaps. Actually an interesting topic.
BottomLine: Good intro to AWS EKS and how you might manage versions of add ons you might install

Description: TLS and SSL are important in securing K8s comms, so we have to worry about how we issue certificates; this article focuses on that, using KIND and cert-manager. We dive right in with short intros to cert-manager then KIND. We then jump to the CLI, and spin up a KIND cluster, and then use CRDs and Helm to prepare for the install cert-manager and the jetstack repo. We do some Helm housekeeping and install cert-manager. We then go through the process of setting up automatic certs via a ClusterIssuer with YAML to cert-manager. We then tour another YAML to generate an actual cert. We then go through the process of setting up ingress and having certs created automatically that way, and thereby allowing external communications to the cluster. Again, more YAML is shown with explainations on how things work. Actually an interesting walk through.
BottomLine: Walk through on automating certs in Kubernetes

Description: We start with Kubernetes is rapidly evolving and security remains   a big concern. The article will focus on one aspect of security, namely Pod security admission (PSA), the successor to PSP or Pod Security Policies. We dive in to a quick background of what PSA does, then talk about how it works with its three predefined levels - privileged, baseline and restricted, with a sentence on each. Now onto how to make it work, and a bit of hand on. We travel through a three step process with YAML and CLI commands, activating PSA, defining Namespace labels and finally configuring the level we want to apply to the namespace. They then go through a quick example, with a restricted manifest. They explain the advantages and strategies for adopting PSA before wrapping up. Short but a good exposition and approach.
BottomLine: Good intro and walkthrough of Pod Security admission on Kubernetes

Description: This is a tutorial on how to get a basic app working on Google Kubernetes Engine, or GKE. We dive right in with the pre-reqs, which is setting up a Google account. They then walk through creating a project and enabling API access. Then then show how to set up cloud shell and configure so you can access your project. Next up they spin up a GKE cluster, and then grab the auth details needed to admin it through kubectl. We are now in Kubernetes, so next they create a deployment with a CLI command and explain it. Then they expose the deployment, so you have access from the Internet. We then verify our app is running in a pod and check the deployed service seems okay. Finally we can surf to the target IP. To conclude, they show how to clean up the service in K8s and also how to delete the cluster to not incur charges. The have an optional bit, where they show you the code, in what I think is a way to allow you to see and modify a bit of code that is K8s deployable.
BottomLine: Good to the point walkthrough on setting up a Kubernetes cluster on GKE

Description: Our article is a walkthrough of K8s RBAC and some kubectl params. Prereq is a Kubernetes cluster, and we start with a sentence on what RBAC is and a link for more details. We start with a kubectl command to verify the auth we are currently using. We go through some CLI, where we can see the auth details. We then talk a bit about certs, because that is how K8s authenticates things, and we go through parts of a cert and the K8s API and what they mean. They then issue some kubectl commands to see what the current identity is able to do. Next, up, we create a key and a certificate signing request, and then get K8s to sign and give us a certificate we can use for identity. We then use RBAC through kubectl to create permissions based on the identiy we created. We then walk through the difference between the user and as parameters to kubectl, before doing some work with them. We use the "as" parameter to verify permissions, which are as we would expect. They then show how "user" fails without local setup, and then proceed to do that setup, which means getting the right cert, and setting that as the credential for the user and then setting context so it can be used. They verify again with user, and all works. They show that a non-existant user doesn't throw an error when checking perms, they just don't have any permissions to do anything. They then go on to create another few users, one of which is a "superuser" and as a power user. They illustrate that using "as" doesn't pull in groups, so while our poweruser has a bunch of permissions they aren't properly reflected when we query with the "as" parameter, so we have to add "as-group" to get the correct result. Overall, a wonderful tutorial.
BottomLine: Great hands-on walk through of creating and accessing Kubernetes through users and RBAC
