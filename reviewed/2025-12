Description: Our article today has a few stories, as it's a wrap for the week, but our interest is on the K8s being the new Linux. The newsletter has a bunch of basket categories, including Cloud Native highlights, Technical practices, and Open Source project recommendations. Upfront they have two projects, one of which tries to enable more fine-grained control. In tech practice, there are three artcile summaries, including our new Linux one. They make the strong point that now orgs are customizing K8s highly, even adopting specialized Kernels to tune things up. There are also orgs that are building pieces that are widely used. We close up with 4 projects, including Kftray, a way to manage runtime envs from a visual tool.
BottomLine: Decent coverage and overviews of many Kubernetes and Cloud Native items

Description: This is a guide to Kubernetes in production - well thought out, in various chapters, and quite beefy. I only skimmed it so far, but it is well set up and also well organized, you can tell they put a lot of thought into the appraoch and layout. Definately a thing to check out.
BottomLine: A substantial guide to running Kubernetes in production

Description: Today's article is about vulnerabilities in runc that were recently disclosed. Our article starts with a bit of background, and then we dive into the vulns - and there are three of them. First is an issue with how masked paths function, and can mean a well chosen mount can cause a breakout or host crash. Next issue is a similar problem with /dev/console based mounts, allowing read/write access to a sensititve filesystem. The final issue is more complex, allowing bypass of LSM (linux security modules) and then allows redirected writes which can cause host crashes or container breakouts. They talk a bit about exploitation scenarios, the biggest of which is multi-tenant scenarios, where one tenant can gain access to containers they don't own. We then go through affected versions and then mitigations, which include not using the root user in the container, adding things like SELinux or AppArmor, and using namespaces without the host root user mapped into it. They do mention other runtimes are also affected.
BottomLine: Good walkthrough of runc issues and mitigations on Kubernetes

Description: Our article today is going to be a comparison of Kubernetes vs Docker as supporting software. We start with a bit of background before diving into Docker, and what it's all about. It goes through a few of the highlights of Docker, including it being lightweight, giving apps isolation, supporting CI/CD and having a way to easily build images with Docker compose. We then pivot to Kubernetes, along with its highlights - HA, self healing, load balancing, and rolling updates to name a few. They position Docker as the lighter weight cousin, for developing and doing small apps, where K8s should be used for big apps in production. They also do point out they can be used together, as they have different focus. 
BottomLine: Good review of where to use Docker vs Kubernetes

Description: Today's article is on how AI might change our underlying infrastructure. We start with a bit of background, focused on cloud providers and their offerings now. They say that MLOps, or the ingestion/train/inference cycle is something that CPU centric stacks don't meet. The shift, they claim, is going to move from CPUs to GPUs, or Graphical processing units. They mention that GPUs, having specialized cores have an advantage over typical CPUs. They mention that Kubernetes is key here; and making sure that the GPUs aren't idle or underutilized is critical. They also play up Vector databases, which is what they say AI will leverage to access data. The piece goes on for a bit more, but it is very abstract and doesn't really dive into how to operationalize any of these interesting ideas.
BottomLine: Good thinkpiece, but is very abstract on AI infra shifts

Description: This article is a quick summary of EKS capabilities by a third party. The focus is a recently introduced feature called EKS Auto mode, which simplifies the management of Kubernetes infra; and talk about new additions like ArgoCD and other tools. The pros they say are that you don't pay for CD or the tools, because you aren't running them; the cons are that it is charged as part of EKS capability pricing, and you can't customize them. The piece also includes a nice infographic about the offerings.
BottomLine: Short piece about new EKS auto mode and related offerings
