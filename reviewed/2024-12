Description: This article is an intro to Kubernetes and DevOps. We start with an overview of Kubernetes, where it talks a bit of history and then gets into the nitty gritty of K8s, talking about lifecycles and nodes among other things. It goes through an 8-point list of K8s features, each getting a good sentence of explaination. We then look in DevOps and DevSecOps, explaining what they are, and how they improve the management of resources. They talk about CI/CD, and then IaC as tools to help this. We then touch on prog lans supporting K8s, with a list of the 8 most common. The article mentions parent company, but they mean current owner, and explain how it started as a Google project but now is under the CNCF umbrella. We end up with talk about open-source versions of K8s compared with managed versions like at a cloud provider. Has some insights, but the formatting is a bit odd.
BottomLine: Decent intro to Kubernetes and DevOps in general

Description: This is a prediction post, at the milestone of Kubernetes being 10 years old. There are some strong predictions - that eBPF will play a major role going forward, and that OpenTelemetry will vie for a spot in the monitoring of Kubernetes stuff. There is some introspection about things like Ingress and service meshes. With the new Gateway API emerging, they argue it's time to move on from traditional Ingress. There is a bit of coverage here on AI as it relates to Kubernetes networking; they break it into two parts. They also talk a bit about a new rev to CNI vs possibly evolving to something like Kubernetes network drivers. An interesting piece to read.
BottomLine: Some interesting discussions on the future of Kubernetes now that it has reached ten years

Description: This article goes over Kubernetes health checks with probes - to see if your app ecosystem is working. We start with a definition of probe, and then a quick overview of the three main probe types - liveness, readiness, and startup. For each time, we get a purpose, how it works and when to use, and wrapped up with an example. There are even diagrams! We do a basic config runthrough for a probe, and then they do a "demo" to show how this works in real life. They spin up some pods, and disable the liveness probe, which they then trace through to see a restart. Actually a decent treatment.
BottomLine: Goes through different Kubernetes probes, and then shows a demo of them

Description: The focus of this article is how to improve Kubernetes security by strengthening RBAC. We start with a discussion of K8s, and we get links to arch and workload discussions. They then contrast deploying a monolithic app vs deploying a K8s one, and how being distributed impacts things. Next we have a bit of a thread about how not all K8s users need to be full admins, but rather just access to the resources they are developing or deploying. They mention things like time-based tokens, as well as limiting the impact of say a dev's creds getting leaked, if things are set up right. They talk a bit more about RBAC, and introduce the objects - Roles, RoleBindings, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding and ServiceAccounts. They then walk us through how to set up a user to authenticate with a certificate. Next, we are walked though permissions, specifically creating a role (or cluster role) to allow something, and then using a role binding to attach that role to a user, giving them the permission. They then talk a bit about User and Service accounts, and what the purpose of each is. To wrap up, we go through some of the challenges with K8s RBAC, with a small plug for a package called Devtron which can help with this. Decent coverage of a hard topic.
BottomLine: Decent intro to RBAC for Kubernetes security
