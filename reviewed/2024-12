Description: This article is an intro to Kubernetes and DevOps. We start with an overview of Kubernetes, where it talks a bit of history and then gets into the nitty gritty of K8s, talking about lifecycles and nodes among other things. It goes through an 8-point list of K8s features, each getting a good sentence of explaination. We then look in DevOps and DevSecOps, explaining what they are, and how they improve the management of resources. They talk about CI/CD, and then IaC as tools to help this. We then touch on prog lans supporting K8s, with a list of the 8 most common. The article mentions parent company, but they mean current owner, and explain how it started as a Google project but now is under the CNCF umbrella. We end up with talk about open-source versions of K8s compared with managed versions like at a cloud provider. Has some insights, but the formatting is a bit odd.
BottomLine: Decent intro to Kubernetes and DevOps in general

Description: This is a prediction post, at the milestone of Kubernetes being 10 years old. There are some strong predictions - that eBPF will play a major role going forward, and that OpenTelemetry will vie for a spot in the monitoring of Kubernetes stuff. There is some introspection about things like Ingress and service meshes. With the new Gateway API emerging, they argue it's time to move on from traditional Ingress. There is a bit of coverage here on AI as it relates to Kubernetes networking; they break it into two parts. They also talk a bit about a new rev to CNI vs possibly evolving to something like Kubernetes network drivers. An interesting piece to read.
BottomLine: Some interesting discussions on the future of Kubernetes now that it has reached ten years

Description: This article goes over Kubernetes health checks with probes - to see if your app ecosystem is working. We start with a definition of probe, and then a quick overview of the three main probe types - liveness, readiness, and startup. For each time, we get a purpose, how it works and when to use, and wrapped up with an example. There are even diagrams! We do a basic config runthrough for a probe, and then they do a "demo" to show how this works in real life. They spin up some pods, and disable the liveness probe, which they then trace through to see a restart. Actually a decent treatment.
BottomLine: Goes through different Kubernetes probes, and then shows a demo of them

Description: The focus of this article is how to improve Kubernetes security by strengthening RBAC. We start with a discussion of K8s, and we get links to arch and workload discussions. They then contrast deploying a monolithic app vs deploying a K8s one, and how being distributed impacts things. Next we have a bit of a thread about how not all K8s users need to be full admins, but rather just access to the resources they are developing or deploying. They mention things like time-based tokens, as well as limiting the impact of say a dev's creds getting leaked, if things are set up right. They talk a bit more about RBAC, and introduce the objects - Roles, RoleBindings, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding and ServiceAccounts. They then walk us through how to set up a user to authenticate with a certificate. Next, we are walked though permissions, specifically creating a role (or cluster role) to allow something, and then using a role binding to attach that role to a user, giving them the permission. They then talk a bit about User and Service accounts, and what the purpose of each is. To wrap up, we go through some of the challenges with K8s RBAC, with a small plug for a package called Devtron which can help with this. Decent coverage of a hard topic.
BottomLine: Decent intro to RBAC for Kubernetes security

Description: This article will talk about OpenShift, and how Kubernetes supports that software. We start with a bit of author background before diving into OpenShift from Red Hat, and what types of things it enables. They note that it is a variety of tech that it makes work, both UDP and TCP, from all areas and doing lots of things. They do mention AI driving better access to hardware accels like GPUs, and how things like dynamic resource allocation work. They touch on things like LeaderWorkingSet and security stuff lik Zero trust. So, my take - this is a decent topic but not really done well. There is lots of things going on but the coverage is a word or two here. I think it would be better to have a longer piece, or have a short intro which leads to longer pieces.
BottomLine: Maybe too quick a survey of the OpenShift and Kubernetes landscape

Description: This article is a test of which Kubernetes network plugin you should use. I've read a couple of these, and usually they are fluff -- this one is an actual test with benchmarks. We start with a bit of background and identify the 4 that we'll be testing - Flannel, Cilium, Calico and Canal. They give the hardware setup too, so you can see how things are set up. For each plugin, we get a short blurb, a point-form key features section and then a working principle section, along with a architecture diagram. They put it through 5 different networking tests, and honestly they were all competitive in most of them. Some of them had slight edges in certain tests, but they didn't vary that widely. They then looked at RAM and CPU utilization, and most were close but Cilium used almost double the RAM and CPU. Well done test and article!
BottomLine: Recommended read testing various network plugins for Kubernetes

Description: This article tries to address some of the concerns surrounding running databases on Kubernetes. We start the meat of the article by looking at the operator pattern, which we are told is for managing stateful workloads. They point out that there are a number of operators for each DB, so this could mean different teams running the same DB have different implementations, which could cause issues. They do try emphasize that running older operator is an advantage, as they may have better coverage of edge cases. The draw out a number of essentials in a DB - backups, monitoring, disaster recovery, high availability and connection scaling. Each get a para of discussion on what an operator needs to do to address this, and how they tend to do so. Next up, we look at "cloud native" considerations, and these include - disk storage solutions, backups and object storage, ease of use and scalability, and finally upgrades and maint -- and again, a para for each topic. They end with some words about how it is no longer a concern to run DBs on K8s.
BottomLine: Decent intro to running DBs on Kubernetes

Description: This article will dive into Service Accounts, and show us the difference between the Default account and Custom Service accounts. We start by a bit of info on what Service Accounts are and how they work, basically allowing a Pod to talk to the K8s API. They explain this is simiilar to a user account, and is so pods or other resources can be allowed or denied from various API activites. There is a default account per namespace, and if you don't specify when creating a pod you then get this default. Basically this means that a pod has full access inside a namespace, which might be more permissions than you want to grant. Now we go on a step by step process of creating a custom service account - they use the CLI to create it, then a bit of YAML to associate it with a pod, then going through the RBAC mechanism to give the custom account the access you want. Good walkthrough, decent explaination.
BottomLine: Good and easy to understand explaination of Custom service accounts on Kubernetes

Description: This is an exploration of Kubernetes security in an AI adjacent environment. We start with a ref to an earlier article which looked at control planes, where this article looks at data planes. We start with a diagram, and there are some pretty ones throughout. We dive in to talk about applications, and they do mention that any app can have code issues that allow attackers access, like RCE. They also talk about priv. escalation, which helps after establishing an intial foothold. After talking about the issues, they then talk about steps you can take to prevent this, including using least privs and building good security boundries. They walk through NodePort service, noting that it isn't used in production much, and enumerate some of the security concerns there. Next up they talk about images and supply chain security, with a few solid recommendations. Finally, they tackle "execution as a service", where K8s runs some 3rd party binary, usually to access an AI model or similar. They liken it to executing arbitrary code, as the prompts that are passed are not controlled by our app. They outline ways to mitigate the possible impact of AI-facing attacks.
BottomLine: Interesting security areas involving Kubernetes are discussed.

Description: This article is about upping your game, from using YAML files to being able to control Kubernetes through CLI kubectl commands. It's a bit of a walk through, and we start with just simply spinning up a Pod. Next we allow those outside our K8s cluster access to our webserver. We then do a couple pod commands, one to show all pods and one to get details of a single pod. We then look at getting logs from a pod, and cleaning up by deleting a pod. Next we look at scaling, by adding replicas and then looking how we can do updates to pods. We then peek into how we get a shell on a pod, to do troubleshooting. It goes on like this; into a thing, give the CLI command, and a short explaination of what is going on, for 40 commands. Actually a good primer into K8s CLI!
BottomLine: Decent quick walkthrough of a lot of Kubernetes CLI commands that are useful

DateReviewed: 2024-12-11
Description: Since Kubernetes is complex, this article claims that it constantly needs optimizaation, and remarkably, the tool they talk about is the right choice to provide this optimization. The tool they talk about is PerfectScale. They talk about node-level optimization, where the seeming focus is on allocating the right CPU and GPU power, alongside memory and storage, to ensure Kubernetes worker nodes are right-sized. They point to "wastage" of 30 or even 50%, but without explaining exactly what is being wasted. They focus on "pinpointing idle capacity and planning budgets effectively". But we don't get any insight here into what idle capacity means, or how costing is working -- there are no technical details. With that, they then pivot to AI, which is using more GPU then CPU. Apparently it's using up 75% of hourly cloud costs, which might be a decent estimate. They do mention misconfigs can cause instability, so you don't want to over or underprovision by too much. While the message is solid, there is near zero tech info to inform a decision; so not a great article.
BottomLine: Skippable article on a solid topic - managing GPU and Kubernetes costs

Description: This article talks about generating an SBOM, which is an inventory of dependencies, from your container images. We dive right in with a description of what comprises an SBOM, and then move on to the tool they are going to use to generate the SBOM - Docker Scout. A quick word on why we want SBOMs, and then the CLI command to generate an SBOM from Scout in JSON. We get a couple of output format variations, before looking at how to save it to a file. Helpfully, they show how to generate an SBOM during the build process, by adding a few parameters to the Docker build command. They mention that Scout works with local images, image tarballs and also registry images. This is a great quick walkthrough - recommended.
BottomLine: Recommended walkthrough on using Docker to create SBOMs
