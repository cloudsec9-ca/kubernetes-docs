Description: This piece positions itself as a Cloud sec best practices for small biz; I have some thoughts on this, but let's dig into the article first. They say they want to dive into risks, and give that all of one sentence. So on to best practices! They have 10 best practices, and use a formula of "what it is, how it helps, implementation tips" on all practices. Covered includes Data encryption, access controls & identity mgmt, security audits, MFA, Incident response planning, data backups, vendor security assessment, employee training, secure config and finally legal and compliance regulations. They then list 5 ways using best practices saves money. Now, the covered topics are decent and fine intros, and the saving money is nice. My problem with the piece is that it is aimed at small biz, and where would small biz have money for audits and incident response? This feels more aimed at mid-sized biz, or maybe in AU small biz is bigger?
BottomLine: Okay intro but weirdly aimed at small biz for Cloud security

Description: So here, we're looking into mutual auth for SSL, or mTLS. Now, the setup is a bit weird, as it refers to a certain website, but okay. They then go on to show you the OpenSSL commands, without really explaining what OpenSSL is or what they do (they create keys, then a cert request, then sign the certs). They then use the certs to create Kubernetes secrets. We then get YAML to deploy the certs, which is cool, and to access them. Finally we do a test with Curl to validate the keys. While this is scriptable, I did just review a mTLS setup that does the Cert process for you. But this is a good local test alternative.
BottomLine: Shows you how to set up mTLS for Kubernetes on the CLI
