Description: This piece positions itself as a Cloud sec best practices for small biz; I have some thoughts on this, but let's dig into the article first. They say they want to dive into risks, and give that all of one sentence. So on to best practices! They have 10 best practices, and use a formula of "what it is, how it helps, implementation tips" on all practices. Covered includes Data encryption, access controls & identity mgmt, security audits, MFA, Incident response planning, data backups, vendor security assessment, employee training, secure config and finally legal and compliance regulations. They then list 5 ways using best practices saves money. Now, the covered topics are decent and fine intros, and the saving money is nice. My problem with the piece is that it is aimed at small biz, and where would small biz have money for audits and incident response? This feels more aimed at mid-sized biz, or maybe in AU small biz is bigger?
BottomLine: Okay intro but weirdly aimed at small biz for Cloud security
